Quentin Silvestro: You told me. Let's smash it. Ra.
Ignacio Joaristi: Hello, Quentin.
Speaker 4: Hey, how are you?
Quentin Silvestro: Good, thank you. Is it.
Ignacio Joaristi: Is it. Is it very early for you right now?
Quentin Silvestro: Please don't kill us.
Speaker 4: No, it's not.
Ignacio Joaristi: Okay, great.
Speaker 4: Where are you guys located?
Ignacio Joaristi: We are in Germany. Both of us. I'm in Berlin and Quentin here is in Hamburg, so.
Speaker 4: Oh, I see. Wonderful.
Quentin Silvestro: Yes.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yes. Great. And you in Guatemala.
Speaker 4: Guatemala? Yeah. The same as Alejandro. I know. Probably you know Alejandro or it's just the very first time.
Ignacio Joaristi: No, no. I. I spoke with Alejandro. I had a chance to speak with Alejandro on Wednesday. Yes.
Speaker 4: Oh, wonderful.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yes, yes. I'm. I'm from near Guatemala. I'm from Costa Rica. So. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Ignacio Joaristi: I was in Guatemala only a few times when I was really young. I remember it was really, really nice. I went to Panachachel and it was super nice.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 4: So you recall correctly. Yeah, yeah. Wonderful. Yeah. Because I actually live on. Well, I couldn't say that I lived there, but yeah, I was leading some projects on Costa Rica as well for around.
Quentin Silvestro: Really?
Speaker 4: Yep.
Ignacio Joaristi: Where in Costa Rica and San Jose or where area?
Speaker 4: Actually.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Hello, guys.
Ignacio Joaristi: Hi, Alejandro. How are you?
Speaker 3: Very good, and you?
Ignacio Joaristi: Great, thank you. This is my colleague Quentin, by the way, that I'm very happy that you're getting to meet.
Speaker 3: He's the pleasure to meet you, Quint.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, nice to meet you too. Thank you.
Ignacio Joaristi: You can introduce yourself maybe. Quentin, I don't have to introduce you.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you. Okay. Hey guys, My name is Quentin. Very nice to meet you. I'm actually one of the first employees here at beam. Started building our go to Market motion over the past one and a half years and working very closely with our large clients. And I always say my role is to start building these agentic journeys in clients, which means, hey, let's look at a company like yours for example, and see where can we start strategically implementing AI and go towards this picture that we like to pitch, which is called this AI native organization. Yeah. Mainly working with our larger clients and collaborations and strategic partnerships, mainly BPO practice and also some larger enterprises who use either shared service centers or BPOs for their operations. Yes, There we go.
Speaker 4: Wonderful.
Ignacio Joaristi: Thank you. Quentin. Hi, Agustin.
Quentin Silvestro: Hi, how are you?
Ignacio Joaristi: Late. Great.
Speaker 5: How are you doing?
Ignacio Joaristi: Great. I have to say I was looking for. I'm going to share a presentation in a minute and I was looking for a cool picture of Allied Global to put and I saw a picture of you cutting a ribbon, I think with other people. Maybe I recognize you immediately.
Speaker 5: Maybe, maybe.
Speaker 3: Thanks to principal for your time. Guys, here's G, our chief strategy officer and also Cesar. Cesar is our intelligent automation director. These are also have a lot of experience on financing, accounting and he was leading a big intelligent automation center of excellence for a large enterprise prior to Allied Global.
Quentin Silvestro: So.
Speaker 3: Yeah. So thanks a lot for your time. I just give the team a sneak peek of your solution, but it will be great if you can showcase your capabilities and everything.
Ignacio Joaristi: Absolutely, yes, we would love to do that. We also had a short presentation to give before that if that's all right with you. Would that be fine or would you like to just dive in straight into the platform? Whatever you like. Okay, fantastic.
Quentin Silvestro: Good.
Ignacio Joaristi: Then in that case, let me just go ahead and share my screen.
Quentin Silvestro: Good.
Ignacio Joaristi: Then please let me know once you can see it.
Quentin Silvestro: We can see it.
Ignacio Joaristi: Okay, fantastic. Great then. Yeah. Very happy to be here today with you from the Allied Global Team Just as we have a conversation with Alejandro earlier this week, we thought it'd be worth for us to have a short chat to see if there's any potential synergies of us partnering to meet any needs from your clients directly within your BPO practice. So a bit about Beam AI we look to build a future together through an AI native organization. Meaning you want to be a platform where you can come and build agents within different functions, particularly within CX Finance and Ops along with HR which are the main areas in which we're working out of today. Then a bit about our presence. We are around 55 employees currently founded in 2022. Spent a whole year building our own agentic orchestration layer proprietary one and then after which we started a go to market motion around a year and a bit ago. Yeah our headquarters are based out of Berlin and we also count with an office in Karachi where we have a lot of our dev teams and also go to market offices in Abu Dhabi and New York. Then a bit about where we see the future of organizations. As Quentin mentioned, we look to start where we're at right now in the midterm where we have a hybrid workforce. We have a few agents working in isolation, having some humans in the loop to make sure the output is correct, always ensuring that the result that is client facing is highly accurate and efficient as well. Scaling in the future have a few subject matter experts that can orchestrate agents to carry about a small function of an organization. This is where we're looking to aim for in the coming years as a company. Then a bit about the architecture of our platform. So our agent takes on inputs in the form of triggers which could be a webhook trigger directly through an app. A new email received really is sort of designed when we're creating an agent that follows your SOPs, after which our agent OS is triggered, where we have LLMs that directly execute prompts, integrations that call different apps and tools within it to create a direct output. Which will be all a bit clearer when Quentin shares the tool later on. A bit about our usual delivery process. We like to split this into a four step playbook, the first one being the agent discovery where we go about understanding how your process is built, which tools are necessary, what are the necessary outcomes we need, and what do we want to benchmark the outcome to. Then we have a step where we're developing the agent, we're building the workflow following your SOPs, after which we find some time to train this agent on a basic test data Set where we reach around 80% accuracy. And that leaves a sort of first standing working agent until in the end we finally do some fine tuning and make the agent reach approximately 95% or above accuracy depending on the case. But this is generally where we're reaching with the work of our forward deployed engineers. Then a bit about the applications that we're seeing work within Beam. So first in finance and compliance we have a KYC verification agent, AML monitoring agent as well. This could be interesting. As I remember you mentioned you were doing a push within Colombia looking for smart finance. This could be some potential avenue. We can look at a partnership as well. Within accounting we're focusing on accounts receivable and collections along with account payables processing and invoice matching. And then within HR we have our candidate screening and interview scheduling. And within support we do some ticket routing and priority assignment with some automated responses. Even though I believe, I think you're pretty well set on your contact center from my previous conversation with Alejandro.
Quentin Silvestro: Then.
Ignacio Joaristi: This is just basically breaking it down into what specific workflows oriented workflows that could exist within these different buckets of operations. But this will again depend on your specific sops and processes. Then let's talk a bit about some case studies. So first within recruiting we're working with Booth and partners North American BPO. We have a CV screening agent that's reached 97% success rate or accuracy processing 1000 plus tasks per month. I will dive into it in the next slide into a bit more detail. Then in the second case we have our invoice to cash use case with Beta Covert. Bitcoberg is the fourth largest debt collection company in Germany that was basically looking at hiring a huge amount of clients to meet new demand. Instead, we've deployed 69 agents and we've reduced ticket costs by around 89% and already reached 100% ROI in the second year of deployment. Then finally within CX operations, we're automating ticket triage and response for 6,000 plus tax monthly and 90% accuracy with Lindegas, which is a utility company based out of Germany as well. But now diving a bit deeper into Booth and Partners, the main problem they were facing within their RPO RPO function was that there was inconsistent shortlisting criteria between recruiters, meaning different people had different expectations for what a must have and a nice to have was when doing recruiting manually as well as having to do this within 250 different JDs that were matching people for. So this along with a delayed candidate feedback which was basically resulting in a longer time to hire and limited visibility into how the process was performing, the time per task and how deep they were into the knowledge of how executions were being done within their PO practice led them to contact us and basically devise a solution for them. And within our solution we've acted with airtables, a single source of truth for JDs and evaluation roles. We've created a tool that auto generates rules for every time a new job description is added, creating a standardized basis for screening. We're automating scoring selection matches against resumes and finally handling the structured data directly on Zoho Recruit. Apart from this, we've also devised some other smaller features that relate to the way they work. So for example, we have Google Chat notifications that keep recruiting recruiters aware throughout the hiring process and a new conditional branch within their system where if a job description does not exist within airtable directly, their recruiters are automatically notified to create a new job description to include in the offering. And finally, of course we have some monitoring dashboards for them to be looking at how the agent is performing, the level of accuracy in all the executions and everything else. So yeah, in summary, some stats, 97.8% CV screening success, a 70% increase in CV screening and 10 to hire, an 85% reduction in manual processing which has proved really valuable to them. Then moving on, we have a case study for a client that wishes to remain anonymity where we've been doing KYC verification with 90% plus automation processing of KYB verification. So they were receiving a bunch of documents they needed to manually verify with a specific bpo and then this manual verification proved to be quite a big friction full process for their customers. Long response times, inconsistent follow ups. So in the end we deployed some agents that integrated directly with their case management tools and compliance systems and we built an automated validation workflow for them where we in the end processed around 6,000. We're processing around 6,000 documents every month and also again ended an 85% reduction in manual processing. But yeah, in general the few like the average benefits we're seeing in our engagements are around 80% in time saved, 95% and above accuracy and a 5 to 15% decrease in errors as compared to human work. Again we don't look to completely replace the people, but certain job aspects of a specific process can be of course improved with the use of AI. Then a bit about the team who we are here today. Myself I'm part of the Go to Market team Quentin, who is the Go to market lead for BPO and working a lot within North America in that specific practice. And then just to mention important leaders within our organization, our CPO, Dr. Benedikt Sankfel, who was working in automation for automobiles previously. And then Jonas Diesen, our CEO who was previously a unicorn founder here in Germany. But yes, apart from this, we look to create reliable automation in a self learning manner with agents that get better and improve over time. And basically giving your company an agentic orchestration layer that will basically take you to the, to the next level. Yeah, at this point this is all for the presentation. I don't know if any questions arise before I yield power to Quentin to share his screen and show the platform.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I got a couple. Yeah, I got a couple pretty quick. So yeah, you were saying about these use cases you got. Well actually pretty good success on this. Do you guys have like pre established or out of the box workflows on a specific industry? Because I think that you were like really highlighting the fact that on the finance and the collections and this is specific, I would say background processes, you've been having good success. So do you have any like out of the box following best practices the industry?
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So yes, we call this templates. I will show you in a second. In our platform, the honest answer is in most collaborations, templates can be a starting point to start building. But as every company is unique in the way they work and the systems they use, it most of the time makes sense to create a custom flow for them, which is also fairly easy to do with our help. I would say. Usually what we do is we have, as Ignacio mentioned, these forward deployed engineers, so one dedicated AI agent engineer that's going to sit with you, work with you, map out all of your best case processes and will also spar and advise you on how to do it best in an automation way.
Speaker 4: Got it. Okay, perfect, Perfect. Now in pretty much well the last one on the IDP on the document processing. How good or mature is your engine guys? I mean because yeah, I see a lot of potential on really scanning documents and really well coming up from structure and not a structured format. So you guys have robust architecture there.
Quentin Silvestro: So the answer on how good is the platform or how good is the engine? I would say I would answer it in a way that the use case document extraction and validation is actually one of the best use cases you can start off with. Because either if you're now in BFSI when it's about big KYC, onboarding, documentation, address verifications or whatsoever or if you just need to reconcile an invoice. And with a transaction it's always the same thing. We extract information from a, we think about it and then we do something with it. So essentially this is the best use case to work in and this is also the use case which we've mastered. So along our clients we see, at least after our first project collaboration, 95 to 97% accuracy rates and sometimes even up until 99, we can promise you 100. But I think humans are also never achieving 100%. So the answer to your question is quite vague. It's pretty good. We achieved sometimes 99% accuracy, but we're also happy to prove in a case, for example, together.
Speaker 4: Wonderful. Okay. All right, Good, good. So yeah, I got a couple more, but yeah, let's go with the demo.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, that's cool. You will see yourself for a second and now you see my platform. What I will do now is I'll take you to our accounts receivables world because this is one of the use cases which we've been most powerful so far with our clients. And then I can sketch a bit of an outlook on payables and KYC kyb if that's interesting for your banking clients. And also on the other hand side something which is I would think a quick win to start with and extremely valuable is the whole RPO world which includes the 10 candidate journey from applying up until I hire a person and I need to onboard it. So these are the spectrums that I see in our collaboration as the most and essentially everything we do always come back to this flows. If you neglect hiring for a second, this is I have an order, I either want to do order entry, I do want to do confirmations, then I enter into this bucket of payables, I have a PO that I need to generate, I might sometimes need to chase pos. Then I want to pay these, so I have to do these two and three ways, matching and payables. And then ultimately second I have something good delivered. We come into the receivables part where we always see these friction points along its invoice creation, reconciliation, reminders, donning and collections. These are the flows that we usually see. So jumping into this, what you're seeing here is our platform. You get greeted with a natural language interface where you could now for example start creating agents from. Nice chat.
Speaker 3: Sorry to interrupt you.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 3: Sorry to interrupt. Can we record a meeting? Right, so because I'm, I'm seeing right now and I will be jumping into a Plane in a few moments. So I have to revisit this.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Ignacio, can you start the recording?
Ignacio Joaristi: Absolutely. Let me start that now, Quentin.
Speaker 5: And before you, you continue is the platform multi language in Spanish, English, whichever.
Quentin Silvestro: Perfect. Yeah, we speak 40 languages. Perfect. Cool. So for the recording then you can rewatch this. What we're doing right here is we're greeted with our natural language interface. So everything is chat based is basically what I'm trying to say. So you can create, create agents from here. You can start new workflows or whatever. For the sake of time, I'm going to skip the agent building flow for a second. We have a nice little video that we can share afterwards where you can see, see exactly how agents are set up. And I'm going to walk you through the setup flow. Then on the left hand side you do see a couple of agents. Let's start with the invoice. Invoice creation agent. Agents at Beam are much like human, like workers. Think of me as your little intern that you hire into your finance department and you're going to give me a job. And if I'm going to start working on this job, I essentially start on tasks that I get triggered with. So this might be a new email, there might be a new invoice, and then I look at it and I start following my flow or this process that you taught me to do. So in this case, agents work on the same pattern. They get triggered with something, they think about it, they follow their flow and they put or give you an output. So if we now, for example, look at this task which I created a couple of days ago, you see, the agent gets triggered with a sales order. There's an order id, there's an order date, there's a customer number, there's text numbers, and there's everything I need to know as a human being to proceed further. So what I'm now going to do in an invoice creation flow, I need to verify is this a valid sales order or not. So I'm going to extract everything. I'm going to think about it, I'm maybe going to look to look up in a database to see if the sales ID or so number is correct. Then I'm going to do the verification. I'm going to identify the tax number, the currency, and ultimately if everything makes sense, I'm going to populate the invoice. Right. What you see here is an SAP tool. For the sake of the demo, we mocked this tool. So this is not a hard integration because SAP might be A bit tricky in the API and very custom with clients. Ignacio also has a demo later for you if you want to see an actual agent working and pushing data from A to B. So this is just conceptual, but if I come back to the flow, the agent is going to do the exact same things that I was just showing you. It's going to verify a sales order, it's going to work on the customer verification, and ultimately it's going to populate the invoice. And if you want, it can also flag the. Flag it for review in a channel. A lot of our clients, for example, they don't trust the AI immediately. They want to have like human in the loop steps, which you can do either via the platform directly. You set a consent required here and now. Every time the agent hits this point, it's going to ask you if this is okay to proceed or. And if not, you can just have these escalation flows where he sends you something in a channel. Now, the invoice creation flow is, I would say, fairly easy. If we now go into the reconciliation flow, this is a bit more sophisticated. So what you see here, the agent is essentially receiving payment data in your transaction history. So what we can do, we can fetch all of your latest transactions from either an accounting tool that you have, and then we're going to fetch all of the outstanding invoices and then we teach an agent to look at them and compare them. Do I have a match? Is this transaction matching to an invoice that I've set in order to reconcile this invoice? And then we do have some escalation flows which are, for example, is it a partial match? Was maybe just the amount correct? But the, but the invoice number was wrong. Or what about the VAT id or the actual text that was paid? So we can build actually quite extensive flows based on your business processes. And I think one thing which is very important to understand is the flow that you're right now seeing is something that we have learned from our clients. For you, it could look completely different. So essentially when our collaboration, we could start in a blank canvas where you basically start mapping out the flow based on your actual business process. And then we're going to train the agent on this and ultimately we are going to have an accuracy. So in this case, our little intern is not 100% trained yet. It's now operating at 68% accuracy, which is not good because in 32% of the cases it will be not inaccurate. So what we're now going to do and this is also a bit where the USP of Beam as a company comes from. We focus on building these very accurate systems for enterprises at scale. So if some of our clients run tens of thousands of tasks, we want to make very sure that the agent hits 95, 97% accuracy. And for that we do have to basically pillars. Either it is going to be in the setup phase, we're going to train the agent and onboard him just like a human being with feedback loops and actually telling him what is exactly good, or we do have a feature which we call the auto tuner, which learns from human feedback. So if I now look at this task and you might say, hey, Quentin, this was wrong, this was not an exact match, this was a partial match. You can give me feedback. And while giving me this feedback, I, I will look at it, I will understand it and I will, I will basically iterate my prompt and I will finish this for a second and then we can engage in discussion. If I talk about a prompt, this is essentially what you see is behind these notes. Let me go into the creation flow because there is a bit better visual. So if you see sales order verification, what we do here is we use the power of AI in order to do verification. And this is essentially what I was just mentioning. AI is extremely good at looking into pieces, thinking about it and verifying if this is valid or not. So behind this there is a tool. In this case, this is an GPT 4.0 tool. We're also an official IBM partner, so we do have the Watson X tools in here and we do a lot with Entropic. We are also able to give you, if you give us your Azure Endpoint or your AWS Bedrock endpoint, we can also implement your own LLMs if this is necessary. And then we're going to have a best price prompt in this case. This is fully generated by the platform and you as an automation expert can now go into this and start playing around with the prompt and actually iterating it or changing it to increase the accuracy. And this is also what our AI agent engineer is going to do with you in the beginning and later on stages, our auto tuner feature will do automatically based on human feedback. One final thing and then I'm really done is we need to connect also to your current tech stack. So we do have a long list of integrations that we have out of the box. So if we're now talking about arap, if you tell us a tool, we can look if we have the integration already or if you Tell us your ATS or HRS for the RPO practice. We can also look in here. We do have most of the most common enterprise stack in here. Everything that we don't have, we can just start connecting via an API key and start enabling the endpoints. Let me pause here for a second before I can also show you kyc, KYB or HR and RPO cases. Any questions?
Speaker 5: I have a small question, Quentin, when you mentioned the retraining purposes of whenever.
Ignacio Joaristi: You give feedback to the.
Speaker 5: To the agent.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 5: From the start you will start using natural language to process or create the agents and the feedback that you, that you give back.
Speaker 3: Always.
Speaker 5: Giving as a, as a natural language to the. To the prompt that you develop first, firsthand. But do you have like a versioning system where you can see what the changes were made into the prompt?
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, yeah, we do. We do have our own evaluation suite for that, which is basically a different product. But we are always going to deliver our clients with this. So you're going to see exactly the versioning and the type of prompt that we changed and what impact it had on the accuracy. And this is then something in an active collaboration that you will get. It's basically a dashboard where on variable level, let's say you're doing invoices and you want to look at invoice number, client name, line items, price. These are all variables. So you're going to see the actual, the accuracy on each of these nitty gritty variables. And you can also see the impact of what the prompt change had on your accuracy on these variables.
Speaker 4: Nice.
Quentin Silvestro: And this is also, this is also what makes us special and why we're successful with these enterprises. Because this is what is essentially important for them on tens of thousands of cases. They want to exactly see in the locks. What accuracy do I have and how compliant slash, how accurate is my agent actually working in order to have it also have it reliably and maybe also exposed to their clients.
Speaker 5: Nice.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you. Of course. Any other questions from your end?
Speaker 5: Not from my part, no.
Speaker 4: I'm good. Yep, I'm good.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, then I have a couple questions. Now, from what I've heard from Ignacio and your previous engagements, is that from my understanding, you basically have three priority buckets in which we could start leveraging automation. It is either the payables, the receivable side, I think, and then there's the whole bucket of RPO and stuffing in HR and recruiting. What do you think from a company perspective, where do you see the. Either the most strategic topics to start or the most low hanging fruits to start testing and validating each other as a partner.
Speaker 5: I don't know Cesar, if you, how, how deep are you with, with the payroll systems and, and, and accounting, but definitely I think the easiest, the easiest path that we can go to is finance since recruitment is now a part of a bigger team with our sister companies.
Quentin Silvestro: I don't know if it is.
Speaker 5: It would be the best approach right now.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay.
Speaker 4: Okay. Probably the punches report, Quentin. I mean, I mean pretty much connected within the whole payroll, but just a couple of steps before the getting into the actual payroll. Yeah, all the batch in, batch out, really completely preparing the staff time, the assistance, all that tracking assistance, I would say mechanism. I think that there's a delay of opportunity to actually come up with some ideas there.
Quentin Silvestro: If I may ask a couple of questions regarding this. A, what's your current tool stack for that and B, what kind of volume are we talking? I mean you have a bunch of people working for you, so is this. And how often do they submit? How often do you have batch in image ALS processes?
Speaker 4: Well, essentially it's a combination of different applications. Well, there are some that are precisely raw data coming from some servers of the client. But the tricky part comes whenever you start transforming all this data according to some specific business rules. On our end it's a in house development, I would say application that has been used to really well track and it's the overall point of control before actually gets to the payroll team or to the finance team. Right. So it's a combination of applications. I can give you the exact details probably on an email, but it's not a specific CRM or something very fancy.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, okay, but that's fine. Do you have APIs available for these tools? We do, we do. Okay, that's cool. Okay, this is, this is the prerequisite that we need though. So the second there is an open API spec or anything, then we can start enabling the endpoints and we can actually make this work, which is good. How much saving would be for this? Like how many people are doing this job? And I'm just trying to get a bit of a sense of ROI here. Like if we would automate this job for you, would this replace people? And if. Yes, how many?
Speaker 4: Yeah, well, not really. I mean I wouldn't say that the whole focus is eft. I mean it's the cost of opportunity because at the end, I mean all this error, all these mistakes has been affecting essentially the actual payment. Right. Or the actual check the final payroll stats. So I Wouldn't say that it's really FTE saving but mostly really enhance the points of cost control and really correcting the. The overall process by re automating and being pretty objective on. On how these calculations or this transformation has been done. Right. So that's essentially I think that there's a big opportunity there. I don't know Alejandro, if you can hear us. But I believe on the RPO as well, right?
Speaker 3: Yeah yeah. RPO for clients also. But back to finance and accounting. Yeah. Because we are thinking on, on. On changing our, our tech stack to a centralized tech stack between different companies. Part of integration. So we, we are, we are moving to a consolidated hris.
Quentin Silvestro: Oh cool.
Speaker 3: And also kind of a workforce management tool. Consolidated. So Bonnie, we can use your solution to integrate everything, I mean to like a BPM type of solution.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, right. Yeah yeah.
Speaker 3: So we can, we can use automation orchestra with all the, the things with moving back and forth. That is number one. Number two is how we embedded this solution in our valuable position not only for contact center but also for back office financing accounting stuff. So it will be great if you can help us to shape that how we can integrate this into our current solution. Yeah. And secondly, probably I don't know the price and cost of this, but probably we can start using it because sometimes as I mentioned to inaction, we built our own orchestrator. This really basic orchestrator, but he's doing the job really well. But something that we don't have is that we are relying on solution like make or nah to do the workflow stuff. So probably I'm thinking that we can for the use cases that we already have in production, we can use your tool as the orchestrator on the back end to move everything, all the automation pieces. So but obviously we need to see the pricing and how the pricing works.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So what you just described as the orchestration layer, basically orchestrating all the pieces, including your existing automation flows is exactly what BIM is. So you basically broken it down exactly to how we understand ourselves and what do we want to be now regarding use cases. Understood. We can go down the HRS path including the RPO for clients as well. I personally think the RPO suite is a quick win because we are very good at it. We have great case studies and grace experience with it and I think we could leverage fast value for you as well. So if you ask us, we would prioritize that. In the end you need to tell us what makes the most strategic value and where you also see the biggest opportunity for yourself. This is just something that we would put on the priority list up and we would makes sense for us. Regarding pricing, Ignacio, did you already explained how we price and especially also in partnerships?
Ignacio Joaristi: No, you can go ahead and dive into that, Quentin.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, so in bigger enterprise collaborations, partnerships are always a bit on a case by case. But I'll start by describing you the pillars. So in an active collaboration, I think there are two dimensions. It is a dimension between allied and beam where we have a collaboration and we start be automating stuff for you internally. And then there's the second dimension which usually comes after this, that we spin this out and make this as an offering for your clients. This is for example, exactly what we're doing with one of our strategic BPO clients, which is Booth and partners. They are predominantly strong in the RPO suite and what we're doing with them that we're building agents along the complete hiring journey internally, essentially cutting down time to hire from three months to one from their clients. This is what we have been building so far. And what we're doing now is that we are basically spinning this out towards their client suite. So coming back to your point, there's a pricing between us and then there's a partnership pricing which is basically could be revenue share, it could be a right labeling solution or it could also be you implement and we are just the AI layer based on your orchestration. Now I know this was a bit long, but it was essentially coming now to this full circle pillar one it's usage. We have a platform fee which is completely based on tokens. As you might know this from LLM tokens, We have our own beam token in which we package in our internal costs with a small margin on top and we call it the beam token. Agents consume these tokens per execution. One token list price is currently priced at 10 cents. So let's say a flow has seven steps. This is going to roughly cost you 70 cents. If we now think of a finance flow or receivables flow that J was just showing you, you saw these had seven to ten steps. Sometimes with bigger documents it can also be going into the 1 or $2 area. But this is a variable price that we're looking into execution or per execution. And we're also happy to adapt because I know you're already working in labor arbitrage situations where these variable costs are fairly low. So we are obviously happy to play around with these numbers. Then on the other hand side, we have a time and material bucket which is basically our man hour bucket. That we put in to build the solution for you and with you. This is on an hourly basis and we charge fairly standard rates for our forward deployed engineers which are now I think at 200 USD an hour and then depending on the scope, we have a budget of hours that we give you and we have the tokens. So this is the core pricing mechanisms. I think to start off a collaboration, if you give us a bit better understanding of your flow, we can give you a rough proposal and ballpark estimation on what this would cost and then you can also look internally how you would juggle these numbers.
Speaker 3: Excellent, excellent. That sounds good. So let us. Let us work on a few use. Use cases or where you can. We can use your tool and then probably we can start with partnership agreements etc and ada. So Austin, what do you think about that left?
Speaker 4: Yeah, he left.
Speaker 3: Oh. So I was think we will take charge of that in terms of probably we can. We. We like to start. I am using internally obviously.
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Speaker 3: But sometimes happens that we put this into our solution. Solution pitch and, and sometimes a new client comes first. Right. So because we are visiting clients and we actually we are working in a few solutions right now but can have a fit for this. So yeah. So let's put together a partnership agreement. I don't know if you already have a standard one, so if you can send us or we can propose a schema. Do you already have partners in Latam?
Quentin Silvestro: Yes. You're. You should know.
Ignacio Joaristi: No, we don't. We do not.
Speaker 3: Okay. And actually you know what? I already saw the IBM orchestrator. Right. It's similar to yours. Right.
Quentin Silvestro: Come again?
Speaker 3: It's similar to yours. Right.
Quentin Silvestro: We are actually, we're partnered with IBM. So IBM is one of our North American partners. And what, what's an axis? They're essentially an orchestration layer which is similar to ours. The honest answer, it's still a bit different, but it's a similar framework. It's their own agentic framework. Yes.
Speaker 3: Okay. Yeah, we can start from there. Right.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay.
Speaker 3: Let us, let us meet. Let us meet internally and, and we will come back to you with a few use cases and a proposal for partnership.
Quentin Silvestro: That sounds great. May I ask one question to verify if you're talking about a partnership at Beam. A partnership usually means a joint go to market market approach where we address your clients. Is this also your, your understanding or would you start building together a use case?
Speaker 3: No problem. Is that, is it that join go to market together? Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, cool. Yeah, makes sense then I think we know what we need to do. In order to get started and to have something feasible and tangible in hand is it makes sense to start looking into some use cases. So if you guys could maybe shortlist the top three use cases that you see in Trinity and with your clients, and then we can go ahead and start building these in the platform and then we can also approach clients together.
Speaker 3: Great. Excellent. Thank you very much.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. Ignacio, any open topics?
Ignacio Joaristi: No, I think not. Excited to hear about the use cases and to see the proposal for the partnership and. Yeah, nothing else. I think this could be very exciting for both parties. So looking forward to this collaboration.
Speaker 3: Sure. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for your time.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you.
Ignacio Joaristi: Thank you very much.
Speaker 3: Bye, guys.
Quentin Silvestro: Bye. Bye. Let's wagon, mate.
Ignacio Joaristi: Like they want to sign asap.
Quentin Silvestro: It's good. I just, I. I didn't want it to push too hard to. To sign.
Ignacio Joaristi: Alejandro is drunk. Hungover, bro. Trust me, this guy is in bed, bro. He probably was in some tango Tijuana. Did you turn off your Amy from last call already?
Quentin Silvestro: No.
