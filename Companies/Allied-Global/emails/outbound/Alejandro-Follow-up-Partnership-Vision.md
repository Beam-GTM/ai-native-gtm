## Email Content

Hi Alejandro,

Excellent conversation on Friday! Attached you can find the Presentation with a quick voice over Video Recording of the Demo. 

## 1) Recap of Our Conversation

**What I understood from Allied Global:**
- You're building a basic orchestrator but need a more advanced AI layer
- You have APIs available and are consolidating your tech stack
- You want to automate finance/accounting, RPO, and payroll processes
- You want to differentiate competitively in the BPO market

**What Beam can contribute:**
- AI orchestration platform with 95%+ accuracy
- Support for 40 languages and integration with existing systems
- Proven success cases (Booth & Partners RPO, Beta Covert collections)
- Flexible partnership model with revenue sharing

## 2) Our Partnership Vision

**Proposal: Start with an Internal Showcase**

I think it makes a lot of sense to build an internal showcase first that demonstrates value before presenting to clients. This will allow you to:
- Validate the technology with your own processes
- Train the team on the capabilities
- Develop use cases specific to Allied Global
- Build internal credibility before offering to clients

**Proposed Use Case: Payroll Automation**

Of everything we discussed, payroll processing seems to be your biggest pain point:
- **Current problem**: Manual data transformation, error-prone calculations, manual verification
- **Beam solution**: Automated transformation rules, automatic validation, precise calculations
- **Expected impact**: 80%+ reduction in processing time, 95%+ calculation accuracy
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for complete implementation

**Alternatives if you prefer:**
- **RPO Automation**: CV screening and scheduling -> Lowest Hanging Fruit as we have great and easy to apply templates here
- **Finance/Accounting**: Accounts Payables or Receivables Use case

## 3) Next Steps

**Immediate next steps:**
1. **Confirm partnership approach** - Internal showcase first vs. direct client approach
2. **Confirm use case for the showcase** - Payroll, RPO, or Finance/Accounting?
3. **Schedule deep dive session** - Technical session with Cesar on integration and requirements

As you mentioned, you also wanted to share our Partnership Agreement framework for our review. Alternatively we could also share an Outline. 


Looking forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
Ignacio
