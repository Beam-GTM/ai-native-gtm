# SLACK DEBRIEF: Fraisa Contract Crisis

**URGENT**: Need team decision by Friday 5pm for Monday Fraisa follow-up

## THE SITUATION
- Contract auto-renews Oct 1st, invoice sent Sept 18th
- Fraisa wants Phase 3 automation before paying (currently Phase 2)
- Kilian working "free" hours - we can't sustain this
- Need to decide: extend timeline vs. enforce contract

## TWO OPTIONS

**A. Feature-based extension**
- Complete Tooltuner + Autor features (whenever they're ready)
- Standard engineering rates (no discounts)
- Preserves relationship
- **Key**: Time doesn't matter, features do

**B. Hard negotiation**
- Current Phase 2 = "Done"
- Full pricing, no preferred treatment
- High relationship risk

## CRITICAL QUESTION
**What happens after Oct 1st renewal?**
- Current contract terms continue?
- New pricing structure?
- Different scope/expectations?

## DECISION NEEDED
- Which option?
- Can we realistically deliver Tooltuner + Autor features?
- How important is Fraisa as reference customer?
- What's our renewal strategy post-Oct 1st?

**@channel - 30min meeting today to decide**
