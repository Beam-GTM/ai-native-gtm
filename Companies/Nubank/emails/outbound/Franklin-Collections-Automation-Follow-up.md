Hi Franklin,

Thank you for the insightful call today. It was great to learn about Nubank's global collections challenges and your vision for more efficient operations across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia.

## Key Takeaways from Our Discussion

I was particularly interested in your point about setting up a **global operation** that can handle the complexity of three different markets while maintaining efficiency. This is exactly the type of challenge our largest customer (a debt collection company) has successfully solved with our platform.

## What We Can Address

Based on our conversation, I see several immediate opportunities:

1. **Multi-Country Process Standardization** - Automate collections workflows while respecting local regulations
2. **External Agency Management** - Streamline coordination and monitoring across agencies
3. **Document Processing** - Automate KYC/KYB document extraction and validation
4. **Communication Automation** - WhatsApp, email, and push notification workflows

## Next Steps

As discussed, I'd like to propose a **45-minute workshop session** where we can:
- Deep dive into your specific pain points
- Identify the highest-impact automation opportunities
- Mock up solutions for your most critical processes
- Discuss technical integration requirements

## Materials Sent

You'll receive by tomorrow:
- **Demo video** of today's session
- **Technical deck** with integration capabilities
- **Case studies** from our debt collection customer
- **Workshop agenda** for our next session

## Questions for Our Workshop

To make our session most valuable, could you think about:
1. What's your most time-consuming manual process in collections?
2. How do you currently handle regulatory differences between Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia?
3. What external agencies do you work with, and how do you monitor their performance?

I'm excited about the potential to help Nubank scale its collections operations efficiently across all three markets. Our platform's multi-country experience and 95%+ accuracy framework seem like a perfect fit for your needs.

Looking forward to our workshop session.

Best regards,
