Hi Carolina and Pedro,

Thank you for the excellent strategic discussion today. It was fascinating to learn about Nubank's expansion goals and how automation can support your growth across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia.

## Strategic Partnership Value

Based on our conversation, I see significant strategic alignment:

**Scale & Market Fit:**
- Nubank's 120M+ customer base provides an ideal testing ground for enterprise-scale automation
- Our proven experience with debt collection (our largest customer) directly addresses Franklin's needs
- Multi-country expansion support aligns with your international growth goals

**Technical Capabilities:**
- 95%+ accuracy framework for critical financial processes
- Multi-country compliance experience (we've handled Europe's regulatory fragmentation)
- Full-service implementation approach vs. platform-only solutions

## Partnership Models

As discussed, we offer two collaboration approaches:

1. **Full-Service Implementation** - We handle everything from workshops to deployment
2. **Collaborative Development** - Joint development with ongoing support

Given Nubank's technical sophistication, I believe the collaborative approach would work well, allowing you to build internal capabilities while leveraging our expertise.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
- Workshop session with Franklin to identify specific use cases
- Technical integration assessment for your systems
- Strategic partnership framework discussion

**Materials Sent:**
- Demo video and technical documentation
- Case studies from our financial services customers
- Partnership framework overview

## Strategic Questions

For our next discussion, I'd love to explore:
1. How does automation fit into Nubank's broader digital transformation strategy?
2. What are your key success metrics for strategic partnerships?
3. How do you typically evaluate and integrate new technologies?

## LATAM Focus

I'm particularly excited about Ignacio's LATAM initiatives. Our early traction in the BPO space and regional expertise could provide additional value beyond the collections use case.

Looking forward to continuing our strategic partnership discussions.

Best regards,  
Jonas Diezun
