Hi Carolina, Pedro, and Franklin,

thanks for the insightful session today. Franklin, you mentioned **"Nubank is less efficient than what I wanted here in multiple aspects"** You're right. A bank of Nubank's size shouldn't be struggling with operational efficiency.

Based on our discussion, we went ahead and researched your specific challenges. We think we have two solid use cases that we can start off with, and here's why:

**The two use cases we identified:**
- **Debt Collection Automation** - addressing your "mixture between operations and credit" challenge
- **KYC Flow Onboarding** - AI-powered address verification → ID verification → source of wealth checks

## 1. Scale & Current State

**From our research, here's our assumptions and what we think how we should get started**

**Nubank's Scale:**
- **120M+ customers** across Brazil, Mexico, Colombia
- **Assumed 1M-1.5M customers onboarding monthly** (accelerating growth)
- **$12B+ receivables**, $1.23B+ overdue (10.2% delinquency rate)
- **16,000 employees** + BPO partnerships for verification

**Current Process Inefficiencies:**
- **KYC onboarding**: 6-10 days average (industry standard)
- **Debt collection**: "Mixture between operations and credit" = inconsistent processes
- **Receivables management**: Manual dunning, reminders & reconciliation across 3 countries

## 2. Opportunity

**Industry Benchmarks Show Massive Potential:**
- **Customer abandonment**: 40% due to slow onboarding (Capgemini 2024)
- **Same-day approval**: Only 4% achieve it (vs. 8 minutes with AI)
- **Debt collection flow**: 10-15% enter dunning stage, 3% progress to collections
- **Competitive gap**: Neobanks like N26 achieve 8-minute onboarding with AI

**What This Means for Nubank:**
- **1.2M-1.8M dunning cases monthly** (10-15% of invoices)
- **360K-540K collection cases monthly** (3% progression)
- **350K-525K customers lost monthly** due to slow onboarding (40% abandonment)

## 3. Value Proposition

**We're Accelerating Your Revenue Machine:**

### Faster Revenue Recognition (KYC Onboarding)
- **Current**: 6-10 days to onboard customers = delayed revenue recognition
- **With AI**: 8-minute onboarding = immediate revenue recognition
- **Impact**: 1M-1.5M customers monthly × 6-10 days faster = massive revenue acceleration
- **Cash flow**: Customers start transacting immediately vs waiting 6-10 days

### Higher Payment Probability (Debt Collection + Dunning)
- **Current**: Manual, inconsistent collection processes across 3 countries
- **With AI**: Automated, optimized collection cycles with local compliance
- **Impact**: Higher payment rates on $1.23B+ overdue receivables
- **Cash flow**: Faster recovery of outstanding debt = more cash in the books

### Optimized Receivables Management (Dunning & Reminders)
- **Current**: Manual dunning, reminders & reconciliation
- **With AI**: Automated upstream receivables management
- **Impact**: 1.2M-1.8M dunning cases monthly processed more efficiently
- **Cash flow**: Faster invoice-to-cash cycles = improved working capital

### FTE Rationalization & Redeployment
- **Current**: Manual processes requiring significant human resources
- **With AI**: 80% automation of routine tasks
- **Impact**: FTE rationalization allows redeployment to higher-value strategic initiatives
- **Strategic value**: Team focuses on growth, innovation, and customer experience vs. manual operations

**Bottom Line**: More customers, faster revenue recognition, higher payment rates, improved cash flow, optimized resource allocation

## 4. What You're Missing Out On If You Wait

**Every Month You Delay Costs Nubank:**

**Revenue Machine Slowdown:**
- **350K-525K customers lost** due to slow onboarding = lost revenue opportunity
- **6-10 days revenue delay** per 1M-1.5M customers = massive cash flow impact
- **$1.23B+ overdue receivables** not optimized = slower cash recovery

**Cash Flow Impact:**
- **1.2M-1.8M dunning cases** processed manually = slower payment collection
- **360K-540K collection cases** without AI optimization = lower recovery rates
- **Working capital tied up** in inefficient processes = reduced liquidity

**Competitive Disadvantage:**
- **Franklin's window closing**: 3 months before processes become "the way we do things"
- **Implementation cost**: 3x more expensive to change later
- **Revenue acceleration**: Competitors gain faster customer onboarding advantage

## Next Steps

**Franklin** - You have 3 months before your current processes become "the way we do things." After that, change becomes 3x more expensive and 10x more difficult.

**Let's Map Out Your First AI Agent Together**

Instead of a generic demo, I propose we sit down for a **scoping session/workshop** where we:

1. **Deep dive into your current processes** - understand exactly how collections, dunning, and onboarding work today
2. **Identify the biggest pain points** - where automation will have the most impact
3. **Map out a first prototype** - design a specific AI agent for your highest-value use case
4. **Define success metrics** - how we'll measure the revenue acceleration impact
