Speaker 1: We are both in Sao Paulo. Where are you based? Brazil.
Ignacio Joaristi: I'm. I'm a tropical fish. But I've. I've been banished to these cold German lands, unfortunately. I mean. I mean I are in Hamburg right now. Normally I live in Berlin, but I'm.
Jonas Diezun: From Costa Rica, so.
Ignacio Joaristi: So I can empathize with the beautiful surroundings you probably have. What about you, Franklin? Are you also in Sao Paulo?
Speaker 4: In Sao Paulo, I'm Sao Paulo, but I'm from Rio. I'm from Rio, so.
Ignacio Joaristi: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 4: More beautiful surroundings than Sao Paulo.
Ignacio Joaristi: I haven't been to either, unfortunately. Hey Jonas, how are you?
Quentin Silvestro: Hi there.
Speaker 1: Hi.
Jonas Diezun: Pleasure.
Speaker 1: I think we have everyone from new bank side. I don't know if we're waiting for anyone from your side.
Quentin Silvestro: We're complete.
Speaker 1: Okay, great. I think maybe we can start with a quick round of intros. I'm Carolina. I'm from nubank's corporate development team. We work with thinking of new strategic opportunities, organic or strategic partnerships and entering new markets or enhancing our capabilities. Pedro, don't know if you want to follow.
Jonas Diezun: Yep.
Speaker 6: Hey folks. I'm also part of the Corp dev team together with Carol. Nice to meet you all.
Jonas Diezun: Nice meeting you as well.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you.
Jonas Diezun: So my name is.
Speaker 4: My name is Franklin. I've been here for a very long time, 10 years now. I now lead the global collections.
Jonas Diezun: So I'm like the business side of.
Speaker 4: Bank here and I just joined recently the position. So I February was came back from paternity leave and I started. I know it's seven months. It's not maybe not that, maybe not that recent but I still feel like I'm starting the job.
Jonas Diezun: That's very nice. That's very great. I think it's best let us start with a quick intro as well and then happy like maybe also you can tell a bit what you want to learn and what you are excited about and then we can fit also maybe what we tell you and what we show you a bit towards that if that is okay.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Jonas Diezun: Then quick intro from my side. Jonas, one of the co founders of Beam back in the day did behavioral economics and electrical engineering and then did McKinsey for a brief time and said this is not so much fun. I read rebuilding companies. So now for the past 10 years built a couple of companies. First one was in AI using data from infrastructure sensors. So very heavy stuff. Back in the days when neural networks were cool. Then founded a company that didn't work out but took a lot of learnings. Founded another company that turned into Unicorn and got Quite big and is now doing 600 million in revenue. And then after that I did some yoga, meditation and all of the stuff that you do when you work for people too much all the time.
Quentin Silvestro: And.
Jonas Diezun: And then we were like, hey, AI is growing exponentially. Humans are not. That was in 22, before the whole ChatGPT hype. And we started Beam and we said, let's try to automate some work. And then we had like one and a half years where it was really, really hard to get these agents to work and very often it didn't work. And now we help companies to automate all of the boring stuff that people don't really want to do. Our largest customer is actually a debt collection company, but we also work with Great Republic Neobank in German, work with large enterprises like Volkswagen for example, and we help them across different processes. Generally we take all of our customers or partners that we work with on a journey. So it's not like, hey, look, here's a platform and good luck. But we kind of support on that journey, whether it's from like the first workshops to really then deploying solution engineers and figuring out what needs to be done. Maybe Quentin and sure.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you very much, Jonas. Hey guys, my name is Quentin. I'm one of the early employees here at beam, mainly responsible for our larger strategic clients. I would say, as Jonas mentioned, two of them, which I think very applicable to us. For example, the Neobank where we did a lot of KYC flows, onboarding tens of thousands of customers every other month. And also the collections customer. I always say my role is more or less building these agentic journeys, which basically means working very closely with customers, just like in the stage that you are right now exploring and where can we go and start enabling them with Genti. Prepared something for today, but I'll throw it to you Ignacio first and then we can take you through.
Ignacio Joaristi: Sounds good. My intro is way shorter than both of theirs. I'm Ignacio, joined the Go to Market team around six months ago, helping here on the Go to Market efforts and happy to be here in this call.
Quentin Silvestro: And leading LATAM initiatives. This is important.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yes, yes, this is important. This is also important. Also I am here.
Speaker 1: Very nice to meet you and thanks again for scheduling. This time I think maybe I can start off giving a short overview of our business and the bank and we would love to also learn more about BIM AI and if maybe Frank wants to give a bit of insight on where we are regarding collections, I think it would be helpful as well.
Speaker 4: I think you can start and then I can connect collections and yeah.
Speaker 1: Nubank. I don't know how familiar you are with the company quite quickly over the last few years, but Nubank was founded in 2013 in Brazil and in a context in which there were no digital banks in the country. And the incubant banks used to dominate this market, charging very high and hidden fees to customers. So customer satisfaction with banking products was very low. And nubank started with a flagship credit card product with no fees and later started launching other products such as an account, personal loans and reached quickly reached a very large scale in Brazil and always with a customer centric culture trying to make customers love us fanatically. And in more recent years we've expanded our product suite to other services outside as well of financial services such as Marketplace Telco. We also have today an international account. We offer insurance products and so on. And today we have reached the penetration in about 60% of Brazil's adult population. We have over 120 million customers in all of our operating geographies and we also serve customers in Mexico and Colombia. In Mexico we have about 15% of penetration in the outdoor population and in Colombia about 10% which is picking up quickly. And we have ambitious goals to expand to other geographies and expand our product suite. And maybe Franklin, if you want to give a little context on our current collections standpoint.
Speaker 4: Yes. So some like basically like more maybe oversharing a bit briefings. Could you give context? So like I recently joined collection. I think the struggle I have in collections as you probably have realize like talking somehow some money banking is still a mixture between operations and credit and everything. So it's I'll say like new bank is less efficient than what I wanted here in multiple aspects. And like we're now in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and you know, the visa megalomaniac.
Jonas Diezun: So for sure we're studying other countries.
Speaker 4: So the struggle I have is like how can I set up like an operation that is like, it's global? I think that is like, that is super valuable for, for me. So I'm looking for like the ways I can mostly like automatize process monitoring everything like, like external agencies, everything I can think of. So that's how we landed into you. And I think that may be a good segue.
Jonas Diezun: Okay, excellent. Maybe we just take over and show you also quickly our product because it will help you to understand exactly what we're doing and how we're doing it. Maybe a couple of words. So we have done various different processes already from debt collection to kyc to customer support. And our platform is fairly flexible in kind of the processes and operations that we can do. We do a lot of enterprise. Every enterprise, every bank, every organization is slightly different. So we know that and we cater for that. We also have had cases already. I mean Europe is fairly fragmented so we have quite some experience with international markets as well. So in for example with Trade Republic in Europe, like regulations in Spain are different than they are in Germany and because of that you need slightly different flows or slightly different processes and if you don't then you have a problem. And that to kind of cater in your system is fairly complex because you don't want to have like 20 different processes but you kind of want to have turned it into that. So we kind of have seen quite a bit of that maybe. Do you want to or should I.
Quentin Silvestro: Let me start. And you just chip in. I think that's good. Let me share my screen real quick. You're going to see yourself for a split second and now you should see the platform, is that correct? Great. I'll make it a bit bigger so you see it a bit nicer. So you're now here greeted in our home screen. As you see in the top left corner, we created a custom workspace for you guys. In this workspace we do have two agents where we thought from our research that these might be relevant to you. I will start going through the debt collection agent and I'll take a quick peek in the KYC operations agent because there are some details in there that the debt collection agent doesn't have, which I think very valuable to show. And essentially think of an agent at Beam just like an intern that you hire on your team. An intern is going to start working on tasks if you give them them and then it's going to operate on an sop. It's essentially a process description that you teach your worker and they're going to follow each individual step. So in this case, before the Demo, it's now 4pm In Germany, I started triggering this agent with a couple of test cases. This agent is now trained on a what we think could be a potential new bank debt collection flow. As you see in the left hand on the right hand side, the agent got triggered 11 minutes ago with a query in this case debt collection case of Joy Silva. And if I follow down, you see all of the input of this agent. It's basically a big payload of what is the customer name, what is the id, what is the outstanding invoice depth, what is the customer history? Were there any Outstanding depths the last two years, for example. And with all of this payload or the information, the agent is going to start performing his task, which you see on the right hand side. So for example, in the first step he's going to analyze what kind of task we have. So if I want to send him maybe a WhatsApp message or what kind of risk is attached to this agent or to this particular customer and then it's going to take this to further process on this flow. So if I now go back into this task again, you will see that the agent is going to take each individual output of a step to perform the, the next step. So in this case it does all of his analysis and then ultimately he starts sending push notifications, he sends a WhatsApp message, he sends an email and ultimately decides, okay, is the, is the customer willing to pay? Do we need to escalate to legal into a dispute resolution flow or can we just close the case? And behind this there's essentially a flow. And this is what we built in our custom workflow builder. This is what I did in front of, in front of the demo to prepare. So these are the exact same steps that you saw in the agent before. So in the first step it's going to analyze all of the data that I get. Then in the next step it's going to perform a comprehensive analysis. As I said, were there any outstanding depths in the last two years, what kind of risk is attached to this customer and how should I proceed? And then ultimately he follows his step. As I said, push notifications, WhatsApp or email. And I think here one concept is important to understand. I'll show it by comparing these two notes against each others. We're either handling with integration based tools which can be a custom API to nubanks backend, but it can also be just an API integration to WhatsApp or email, which is the typical API calls get and post. I get information and I post information back or I use a prompt based tool. And a prompt based tool is essentially what we built in the background. Everything is based on a prompt. You see, there's a best practice prompt that our platform gives you based on the goal that you want to achieve. And this is also what we iterate and we do here is we leverage the power of the LLMs, which they're good at. It's reasoning, it's analysis and it's maybe generating some reports or tests and then the agent is going to follow on all of these tasks. So what I will do in a second, I Will trigger it again. So you see how it runs live on a task. And before I do that, and before I go to the KYC operations agent, Jonas, feel free to chip in, else I'll open the room for some questions already, if there are any.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I have a couple of questions. Just one is out of curiosity. When you're showing the flow, there was some weapon mark, like some precision mark. What does this actually mean? Exactly the same thing.
Quentin Silvestro: Jonas, you want to take that one?
Jonas Diezun: Yeah. Maybe you can actually go on a task and show the evaluation criteria in the task. So essentially, ultimately, in order to get agents in production, you need to be sure how they operate and what accuracy levels they are reaching. And what we do for this is we build our own evaluation framework. Essentially. Maybe you start on. You stay just really briefly on. Yeah, this is good. So this is one particular step. And for each of the step in whatever the agent is doing, we automatically create evaluation criteria. And we use, on the one side, we use historical data. Initially when we start working, you kind of provide test data sets. And we use that to essentially make sure that the agent does things in the right way. And then we constantly monitor this. And now Quentin just put up this agent as a demo. So we didn't really optimize on this. But you can see that the agent here is not really sure of whether it's doing the right thing or not. So typically, 45% would mean it's ultimately a probabilistic evaluation where we say, hey, look, we are not really sure. Should we retry? And then we retry the step. And if we're still not sure, then we probably have to optimize the steps. Now if you go up and click the optimization button, which should be there. So essentially, we provide you also with the system behind that that makes the agent better over time. So we can just automatically improve the agent and ask, adjust the prompts. But what you can do here is like saying, hello, this was right, this was wrong, this was right, this was wrong. And then we use these outputs to improve the agent over time. And this is specifically important for critical processes like kyc, where we want to make sure that we get to like 98% accuracy. So mostly this serves two purposes. One, you see what the agent is actually doing and how certain the agent is in doing something. And second, we use this to optimize the agent over time really quickly. So it took Quentin, I think now an hour at least, or maybe less. Max.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, max.
Jonas Diezun: To set this up. And we can also show you the agent setup because ultimately what you care about is you want to get your agents into production to actually work, but you also want to make this relatively fast. So time to value is ultimately when you get this into production. So we're very fast in setting up the agent and then we're very fast in optimizing the agent and making sure that we can do this reliably.
Speaker 4: Just out of curiosity, two things. One is like what is the precision you tend to get when you're running productions? I know it depends on the criticality of the, of the, of the automation. So if you're, if you're in a hospital, a Life Training Situation, 199.999 something but like in average as you, the clients you have deploy like how much precision you tend to get in each of those steps.
Jonas Diezun: So our target is most of the time in critical processes, 95%. We also get to 97, 98% but we don' to 100% because it's just incredibly hard. But there is an important distinction. So there are some variables or some steps that are very critical. You shouldn't make a wrong decision of whether you now say this claim or like to waive the claim, for example. But it doesn't really matter if there maybe is a misspelling in the address of that person. And so we divide also in critical and non critical variables and we even have the accuracy level on the, on the variable level and typically 95 plus.
Speaker 6: Okay.
Speaker 4: And it's just like you talk a little bit about KYC and I do see like the very obvious value of doing this for KYC when talking about banks overall without getting of course the specific of the banks. What type of automation do you guys normally do with them? Kyc, is there something more like I know there's all the collections, but do people use this? How much the real life usage by banks.
Jonas Diezun: So our largest customer is actually debt collection there. We do pretty much everything from document extraction, address validation, follow ups, crafting essentially everything there might be in certain processes still human in the loops, human in the loop. So that means that still there is a person that is checking the final result. But very often we just then fill for example a form or whatever is required, we fill that out. Generally agents are incredibly good in fetching information, writing information and reasoning about information. And by now we're also usually better than the people doing the job. So yeah, we sometimes now it's the other way around. We spot the mistakes that the people do in the organization. So that's now something that we and.
Speaker 4: Just make sure I fully get it. Like when you say debt collector is basically a collection agency, right? Like so the bank originated the loan and say look, please collect the guy here. They give you the guy. And that's why we like extract information, do all of those things.
Jonas Diezun: Exactly, exactly. We also have document validation to some extent. So for example in kyb, because in know your business you need to extract information from a lot of different documents and then the the business customer is onboarded and then you have 20 different documents and you need to figure out what is the, the ultimately beneficial owner. And these kind of things that that actually we do as well. And then we even draft the UBO organic drum and put it as in a PDF and then people don't have to use that anymore. So it's pretty flexible. Maybe Quentin, if you go on integrations like ultimately I think Quentin said like when you think about the agent, they're really good in thinking they're extracting information and we can use all sorts of different integrations. So for example, you might say now in kyc, like fraud detection there needs to be an extra step. We don't claim that we do the best fraud detection, this is not our specialty. But what we can then do is we collect all of the data, we funnel it to a specialized service, we send it there, we get it back, we look at whatever that service did and then we use that data again. And then the agent is very good in understanding, hey look, maybe I should funnel it to that particular service because I have that ability to use it. And because of that we essentially can use different skills or different things and mesh them together so that we can ultimately get done what is needed.
Speaker 4: Super clear.
Speaker 1: May I ask another question? What type of collaboration models do you typically have with your clients? So do you provide the only the platform or do you work with them to integrate into their solutions?
Jonas Diezun: Yeah, so we have broadly like we have two different approaches. One is we do it for the client and that means we do pretty much everything. We do meetings where we listen and then we build everything for the client. That is with companies that are not that digital native as you might be. The other approach is we do it with the client together and there's always support from our side because it is a bit tricky in the beginning but generally then we want to move out if you want to and then you can do it on your own. So we have then clients that are more on the younger startup or scale up phase. They essentially after we do the first two, three agents and we connect Everything and solve all of the nitty gritty that you have. In the beginning they just build their own agents and we provide you software to do that. So it's a bit flexible generally in the beginning we always like to stay very close and also have our solution engineers because then we can make sure that it works and then over time you can do more stuff on your own.
Speaker 1: Got it. And another question, sorry if I'm not mistaken that your headquarters is in the US but is most of the operations in Germany and the clients and the team?
Jonas Diezun: Yeah, so the majority of the people is in Germany. And now we are starting to build our New York team. So we're a US based company. We're all Germans. We've done stuff from like building autonomous cars in the Silicon Valley, building stuff at Airbus and then getting into agents. But we also then have people in your time zone because ultimately that's important. And then we also frequently travel.
Speaker 6: I was also curious about your Latin operation. Sorry Carla, to jump in, but INASA just joined with the responsibility of covering like what's, what's the current traction with it?
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah, it's, it's very early stages. It's a very, it's a very new push we're doing but we're seeing quite a bit of traction within the BPO space. So we're seeing a lot of clients interested in basically revolutionizing their order to cash. Also within the HR portion of IT recruiting, we're having a lot of traction. We just started around, I would say two, three weeks ago. Really started to push that way and it's so much fun to bring the tech back to where you're from. So very exciting times. Hopefully we will see more of this soon. And these are my current focuses for the coming year.
Speaker 6: Yeah, nice. I was also curious to one of the questions that frankly made there but just so we can expand a bit on that. But in terms of your financial services customers, you would say that know youw customer is the, is the main, I would say solution they're hiring and looking for or you guys seeing traction in other areas. Just so we sort of figure out how we could potentially partner up here or work together.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. If I may add. And then you ask chip in. I think with most of the financial services customers that we're working with right now, we started in the whole onboarding journey which is essentially KYC and kyb. We then slowly transition more into the whole AML buckets where we do sorts of wealth checks. For example, also with that big German Neobank and now we're currently working on a project with a large Netherlands based credit card issuer to start looking or tapping our feet into suspicious activity reports, triaging alerts and also preparing investigations. So in the whole banking, financial services and insurance world, we are moving towards these more complex flows. KYC is just, I would say one of the lower hanging fruits and easier cases to start off with. And it's usually also a good case to validate each other as a vendor as it's not that complicated. And then you start moving towards the more complex flows. But this is what we see. And then essentially from collections it's very logical to go upstream in the receivables flow. So we do then collections before that is dunning payment reminders, invoice reconciliations and creations as well.
Jonas Diezun: And if I may add, a lot of the stuff that we do initially is not as fancy. It's like supporting on data extraction, doing that, making certain checks. So it's more like using the toolkits and just doing it really, really well rather than doing the complete fancy process. So we might even start just with address verification in the KYC process because then you see, look, this is actually how we save a lot of time. And I mean I think you as a company are probably more advanced. We have some other banks that we talked to where a lot of the stuff is still very stone age. So that's then sometimes so hard that you can't even work with them. Yeah. Because you can't even access any system.
Speaker 6: You'd be surprised. But jokes aside, I think I think that's super helpful context at least from my side. I don't know Friendly and Carol, if you have other, other question for us.
Speaker 4: No, I think for me it's super helpful. Let me digest. I think if there's anything more you can share Async of usage so we can actually I think there's a little bit on my side of really lack of imagination. I can be so bluntly with myself like. So there's anything you can share, like interesting use cases of course, no need to share a custom name, anything, just more we understand really how like how we can use the technology, be really good. But besides that I think I'm good.
Jonas Diezun: Look, what we might also do or could offer is like do a session, like 30 minutes, one hour. And we do quite a lot of workshops and we have certain set of questions that we ask you and within these 45 minutes we're going to ask you a couple of questions and direct you in the like what is the most annoying thing. What is it? This stuff that you don't like. And then we typically, very quickly can say, this makes sense, this makes sense. This doesn't make sense. And we can start implementing. So we're very like, ask a couple of questions, and then we mock it up. And then you imagine it how it looks like. Because what Quentin just showed was now without any prior knowledge. And if we do that with some input, then it's typically I. Now I get it. How this works and what it can do for me.
Speaker 6: Makes total sense.
Jonas Diezun: Yes.
Speaker 6: All right.
Speaker 1: I think maybe if you want to share those materials with you so we can have some time to digest internally before we schedule this workshop session, it would be great. And then I can reconnect with you, Jonas, so that we can organize the next steps.
Jonas Diezun: Awesome.
Quentin Silvestro: You'll have a deck and a recorded demo video as what exactly we did today in your inbox by latest tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Great. Thank you very much, and it was a pleasure connecting.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you, guys.
Ignacio Joaristi: Thanks, guys.
