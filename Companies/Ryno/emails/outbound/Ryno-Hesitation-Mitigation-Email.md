# Ryno Hesitation Mitigation Email

**To**: [Speaker 2 Email]  
**From**: Quentin Silvestro  
**Subject**: Making Shipment Tracking Work for Ryno's Budget - Let's Start Small  
**Date**: [Current Date]

Hi [Speaker 2 Name],

I wanted to follow up on our call yesterday, and I'll be honest - I sensed some hesitation at the end when we discussed pricing. I want to address that directly.

## What I Heard (and What I Think You're Thinking)

You said: *"Okay, sounds great"*  
What I think you meant: *"This sounds expensive and I'm not sure it's worth it"*

You mentioned: *"It's tough to put a dollar amount to customer satisfaction"*  
What I think you meant: *"I can't justify $2,000/month to my team/boss"*

## Let Me Propose Something Different

Instead of jumping into a full $2,000/month solution, what if we started small and proved value first?

### **3-Month Pilot Program: $500/month**

**What you get:**
- Automated UPS tracking only (your biggest volume)
- Full Odoo integration
- Proactive delay alerts
- Customer notification system
- My personal support for 3 months

**What you risk:**
- $1,500 total investment
- 3 months of your time

**What you gain:**
- Proof that automation works for Ryno
- Exact measurement of time savings
- Customer satisfaction improvement data
- Confidence to expand (or not)

## ROI Guarantee

Here's my promise: **If we don't save you at least 10 hours per month in manual tracking time, I'll refund everything.**

Based on your volume, I'm confident we'll save you 15-20 hours per month, which at $25/hour is $375-500 in labor savings alone. Plus the customer satisfaction improvement.

## Why This Approach Makes Sense

1. **Low Risk**: Start with your biggest carrier (UPS)
2. **Prove Value**: Measure actual time savings and customer impact
3. **Build Confidence**: See it working before expanding
4. **Seasonal Timing**: Perfect timing before your peak summer season

## What Happens After 3 Months?

**If it works (and I'm confident it will):**
- Expand to FedEx and freight carriers
- Add more automation features
- Scale to full $2,000/month solution
- You'll have data to justify the investment

**If it doesn't work:**
- You've only invested $1,500
- You've learned something valuable
- No hard feelings, no pressure

## My Commitment to You

- **I'll personally oversee the implementation**
- **6 months of free technical support**
- **Weekly check-ins to ensure success**
- **Full refund if you're not satisfied**

## Next Steps

I'd like to schedule a 15-minute call this week to discuss the pilot program. No pressure, no sales pitch - just a conversation about whether this approach makes sense for Ryno.

**Available times:**
- [Day] at [Time]
- [Day] at [Time]
- [Day] at [Time]

Or just reply with a time that works for you.

## Why I'm Doing This

I believe in this solution, and I believe it will work for Ryno. But I also believe that the best partnerships start with trust and proven value, not big promises and big investments.

Let's start small, prove value, and build from there.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

**P.S.** - I know you mentioned the seasonal nature of your business. This pilot timing is actually perfect - we can have it working smoothly before your peak summer season, when you'll really see the value.
