**Date**: [Current Date]

Hi [Speaker 2 Name],

Thanks for the great conversation yesterday about Ryno's shipment tracking automation needs.

## Quick Recap
- **Challenge**: Manual tracking of ~4,000 annual shipments across Canada-US border
- **Goal**: Automated monitoring with proactive alerts for delays
- **Integration**: Odoo system with UPS, FedEx, and freight carriers
- **Value**: Customer satisfaction improvement + time savings

## Moving Forward

I have **one remaining kickoff slot on October 1st** that I can offer to Ryno. This would include:

- **20 complimentary AI Agent Development hours** to get you started
- **Full Odoo integration setup**
- **Complete tracking automation implementation**
- **Team training and onboarding**

**Alternative**: We can start mid-October if the October 1st timeline doesn't work.

## Next Steps

Let me know if you'd like to secure the October 1st slot, or if you prefer to start mid-October. I'll send over the formal proposal once we confirm the timeline.

Looking forward to helping Ryno transition from reactive to proactive shipment management.

Best regards,

**P.S.** - The October 1st timing works perfectly for your seasonal business - you'll have the system running smoothly before your peak summer season.
