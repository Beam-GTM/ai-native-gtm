Quentin Silvestro: It. Hello? Hey there. How's it going? Can you hear me? Are you there? Can you hear me?
Speaker 2: My speakers are in trouble.
Quentin Silvestro: There we go. How's it going? Sorry, I just need to find this real quick. I'm in an open office and people start getting annoyed if I'm caught doing calls loud.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Quentin Silvestro: Where are you dialing in from?
Speaker 2: Ontario.
Quentin Silvestro: Ontario. Very nice. Never been, but I spent a lot of time in the U.S. i'm currently in Germany. We're originally founded in Berlin. Most of the team is in Berlin, but I lead the North American expansion at our team. That's also what we have to call today. And I spent a lot of time in New York where the office is, and in Florida where my family lives.
Speaker 2: Oh, wonderful.
Quentin Silvestro: There you go. It's the best. I love it. They're living close to Miami and I'm actually going back in two weeks. And this is always nice because I can combine personal life and work matters. We're at a big conference of IBM. We're an official IBM Magentic AI partner. And they invited us to. They rented half of Disney in Orlando. It's very.
Speaker 2: That's cool.
Quentin Silvestro: Crazy. But enough about the personal stuff. How are you doing? Thanks for dialing in. You do me a great favor if you could give me a rough, rough, rough, rough indication on why are you here and what made you sign up.
Speaker 2: So it's, it's monitoring. Tracking is really what, what brought me to this. So we, we don't have huge volume, but it's, it's enough that, you know, a few, few hundred shipments a week that go from Canada to the U.S. and because of all the customs challenges and, and what whatnot, we're getting a lot of turbulence in delivery expectations. You know, usually it would just cross the border and get there in a day or two. And everything went smooth. Now a lot of stuff's getting held. There's a lot of customs delays and other challenges that are arising. So we want a solution for just having a list of tracking numbers and something monitoring. We usually use UPS and FedEx primarily, but something to flag and let us know if something stops our shipment. If there's some sort of delay or some sort of hiccup in the, in the chain. We're doing it very manually right now.
Quentin Silvestro: Yep.
Speaker 2: Just somebody goes and puts in all the numbers and monitors it. Right. So to have a system do that would be delightful.
Quentin Silvestro: What I hear is the Canadian. Ontario, not California.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yes, that's right.
Quentin Silvestro: Yes. Yeah. Okay. I clicked with California, but now I.
Speaker 2: Get it non specific. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, understood. So generally we do work with. Are you a wholesaler or a manufacturer of the products as well?
Speaker 2: We manufacture and then sell to like a dealer network and then ship to their customers. So it's like a drop ship.
Quentin Silvestro: Got it. So we do work with a couple of manufacturers in the same scale, but also bigger out of Europe and also North America. Most of the cases that we do have with them are within the whole value chain of either order to cash. I have an order and I ultimately have a PO or some goods that I want to procure and pay. So all the payables bucket up until I have an invoice that I want to get paid.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Along this value chain, there are a lot of these friction points which, for example, the one that you just described that we could start, anchor in, automate them, and then we go up to the next one to streamline the whole value chain of order to cash. What you've described is something we see a lot or in a similar direction. Could you describe me roughly? If I would now be. This is usually the metaphor that I use. If I would be a new intern that starts in your team, what would you tell me to do?
Speaker 2: So what we. We've got, we use Odoo.
Quentin Silvestro: I don't know if you know, API.
Speaker 2: We could either just have the tracking numbers. We have a field that we enter the tracking numbers in. And so what we do right now is we export all of the orders and take the list of tracking numbers, copy them, and paste them into the FedEx site. For example, if they're FedEx tracking numbers and then read through the list and anything that is flagged as a delay or being held for whatever reason to raise it up and action it.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay. You use FedEx and UPS, you said, I assume primarily.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're. They're the two. Two biggest ones. There's some freight ones as well that we use, but you know, those, those are the. The bulk of it.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. How many orders are we talking roughly on a monthly.
Speaker 2: It.
Quentin Silvestro: It.
Speaker 2: It's a bit of a roller coaster through the year. So we're kind of in the decline as the weather gets colder. Yeah, we. We do asphalt road repair equipment. So as they aren't working on the road. So our orders kind of peak in summer, you know, something to. So I'll just say we have about 4,000 a year and it kind of is here in the summer, but still.
Quentin Silvestro: Still not evolving enough volume to start thinking about a solution like this. That's basically the Question that I'm having in my head. How many people are working on this particular matter?
Speaker 2: Two.
Quentin Silvestro: Two people.
Speaker 2: Right. So we have kind of an order entry person and a customer service person. Right. And they kind of share it out between them.
Quentin Silvestro: Yep. And you can't come to us particularly with the need to solve this or you look up open to look also left and right in the value chain.
Speaker 2: So Odoo does a pretty good job of, of the rest of it. So our, you know, we've got connectors with our dealers. They order our entries directly into our system. So those processes aren't terribly, terribly cumbersome. The invoicing goes smooth. So it's really just the monitoring the tracking numbers that is the, the problem that I'm trying to solve.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Okay, let's do the following. I'll quickly jump into the platform and I'll show you how this would look like. You now see my screen. Right. So let's just go ahead and create a new agent. You're now in my workspace to just create a new agent that monitors UPS and FedEx tracking. So what I will now do, I start doing this by natural language. It will start asking me a bunch of questions. I skipped that real quick. So just create the agent. We will now start on a blank canvas. So on the left hand side you would see an agent popping up in a second which is then the shipping tracking agent. Give it some time. It now sets everything up. This is now the empty shell of your little internal. So this is your intern on day one. It comes with pre trained university knowledge. But now what we would need to do is to start mapping out the flow. So right.
Speaker 2: Where do you get the information?
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, is it FedEx or is it maybe give it some time. It's not FedEx or is it UPS? And then whenever this one of these then let's say we do UPS then say fetch shipment status from ups. So it will now look if we have a UPS tool already. So it look I think we, we did some, some stuff with some shipping stuff with UPS before. We did a lot of with FedEx. And in Europe you do a lot of with the dhl. See. So when I right now we have a third party API which is basically an aggregator for this. But what we would now do in this case I just checked the UPS has a typical API just as DHL in Europe. So what we would do is we would go to our, leave this here to our integration setup here. You do see Odoo. So we would just connect with Odoo and then what we would do for. I don't think that we have a UPS connector already. No. So what we would do is we just create a customer connector. What we need is the API key. You will find this in your developer portal. This something you, you give us the key and then we can enable it. And then we would go down into this flow. Ah, look, I forgot to save. Typical. Yeah, typical issue. But. And then, okay, it found the UPS shipping and then the next action would for example, be let's say on or analyze status. So if it's analyzing the status, we then go ahead and then we can branch it if at risk, send reminder or that we would branch it out here or escalate to manager or send email to client that shipment is delayed or with shipment status. Is this something that you do proactively or is this reactively whenever a customer asks or both?
Speaker 2: So it's. We're transitioning from reactive to proactive. I would like it to be proactive.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, yeah. I mean we can just look at all of all of the shipments on a regular basis with a scheduler and then see.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Quentin Silvestro: This is what we would do. So I think the general concept of an agent is clear, right? It gets a trigger, which can be a reactive trigger in case of a customer service inquiry, but it can also be a proactive trigger where every Monday morning he looks in the list and he does this right. I'll switch my flow real quick to my customer service space. So you see how agents let's just pick return handling because it's easy. In this case, you see an agent works on a task, he gets triggered. This is for example, reactive flow where hey returns team. I'm following my existing return. The speaker still crackers with high volume. So the tech client, so this is a reactive inquiry. And then the agent goes ahead and follows the steps that we teach him. So in this case, this is the flow needs to identify the content or whatever the person wants. He then branches it and then follows all the steps. In this case he needs to do an approval, sends an email and then updates it in a database as approved. This follows a certain flow. In this case, disk flow is actually quite complex as you see. So it starts with one branch and it goes down a lot of branches and then it ultimately ends up in the bucket we want it to be. So it's not just very linear, but can be very extensive. And then the agent works on tasks. So if I now would want to create a new task, I can either do this from here or we have an API as for example Odoo in this case as a trigger. Whenever there is a new shipment in Odoo track it on a. On a daily or on a weekly basis. So this is usually how it works. We can do a deep dive in a second session but then at least solid ones. And then what I was about to say, then we can continue from there. I mean in the end. Sorry, my colleague is standing here and he's talking about.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So.
Speaker 2: So just to kind of to summarize a little bit, it could be go into Odoo if we give it the proper permission, probably remember which ones are done. Or we could put a little checkbox in Odoo for it to say yeah, this one's completed. And then retrieve the ones that aren't done, analyze them and either manage them by alert or. Or completion. Yeah, I mean that. That would be fantastic. What I suppose comes down to money, right?
Quentin Silvestro: What.
Speaker 2: What does a solution like that, you know, ballpark. I know until you kind of dig in. But what. What's an average or. Or an. An area like. I have no idea really what we're.
Quentin Silvestro: It depends so on. On there's two ways of working with us. A way of working is we do everything for you, we build everything and it's like outsourced. Then it can get a bit. A little bit pricier if you want to do everything yourself. And you might have some techie people internally who are actually able to build with AI Disclaimer it's still super techie and you really need sophisticated people. And then it's fully usage based and you just pay a base fee for the platform and then the usage that you use on top. When I talk about usage this means tokens. Just like ChatGPT or other LLMs we also charge tokens. Currently one token is priced at 10 cents. Let's say a flow has seven steps. Seven seven steps equals 70 cents and then you can do the calculation. I think a good ballpark figure for you to look at is a minimum investment of roughly a 1k a month. This is something that we anchor as the lowest because we want to go into this bucket of a high execution volume and this is what we incentivize. So it will. The investment would probably recoup the second you start exploring more use cases in this order to cash value chain. So the first use case usually an investment which has value obviously and usually it's a zero sum game. And then the second you start expanding and you will see payback the other hand side is if you want us to build, we can either teach you first agent, we chip in a couple of development hours for free and then a couple of them if needed are paid. Standard rates are usually 150 bucks an hour from our engineers. And I would say for one of these agents to be on the safe side, I think it makes sense to budget another thousand a month for at least the first three months. So an additional 3K agent, developer services support knowledge transfer and ensuring that the first agent works. And then depending on where you are after the three months learning, you either book more hours or keep continuing the service that you have, or you downscale it because you don't need us anymore. This is the model that we run. We also have a fully set up academy. So it's like a full learning path where you can go through and teach yourself. I'm going to be honest, it's tricky and it's techie, you really need to sit down. But if you want to make these enterprise systems work, you need to be a bit techy. Exactly. So this is basically, basically how we do it. So if you would for example, have a young motivated individual internally, that's usually what works best. Or you use us as the outsourced AI partner who does it for you, depending on the budget you have. Gotcha. Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and is that U.S. price USD?
Quentin Silvestro: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. You would, you would, you would been served, you would be served from our North American entity, which is out of New York and then it's USD prices.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's awesome. Okay, let me, let me, you know, go back to my team and kind of talk about what we would really exactly need, how we would want it to react and what we want to actually get out of it. Right. So what results and all of that and see if the value's there. Right. And then I'll reach out to you and let you know either way.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, sure. I will follow up Arthur's call with the little summary of what we discussed, also with the prices. And I think for you just to keep in mind, most of the cases where we talk about ROI and value, it's mainly either cost cutting, so you could replace headcount, or it is a top line case if you have like big backlog scenarios, a lot of orders that can't be processed, which makes cash flow, flow and thruster, these kind of.
Speaker 2: Scenarios, usually for us it's, it's a customer satisfaction game. So it's a tough intangible value of frustrated customers who you know, their, their shipments getting stopped. We didn't notice. It's been a couple of days, and. And then it just becomes so. So it's tough to put a. A dollar amount to that. However, it's the, the life or death of a company. Right, So.
Quentin Silvestro: I see, I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So the value's there. It's just.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I agree. And if price is a thing, I mean, if for us it's important, if we do see expansion potential along this order to cash chain, I can do something with the price. Just let me know if that's the main bottleneck, and then I can come up with something exotic.
Speaker 2: Okay, sounds great.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. Thank you very much for time and interest. You'll have an email from me and see you soon. Bye. Bye.
Speaker 2: Okay, take care.
Quentin Silvestro: Bye.
