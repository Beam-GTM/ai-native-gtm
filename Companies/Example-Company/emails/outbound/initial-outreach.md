Hi Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. I came across Example Company and was impressed by your recent expansion into new markets.

I noticed that as companies scale like yours, manual processes often become the biggest bottlenecks. Many of our clients in similar positions have seen significant efficiency gains by implementing AI automation solutions.

**Quick question**: Are you currently dealing with any manual document processing or data entry that's taking up too much time for your team?

If so, I'd love to share how we've helped companies like Example Company automate workflows and reduce operational overhead by 40-60%.

**Real example**: We recently helped a similar tech company automate their invoice processing, reducing their finance team's manual work from 6 hours to 30 minutes daily.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call this week to explore if there might be a fit?

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Title]  
[Your Company]  

**P.S.** - If now isn't the right time, I'd be happy to share some case studies that might be relevant to your current initiatives.
