Brief for Sportsbet Meeting
Hi Derya, Jonas, 

Thank you both for taking the time on Tuesday to dive deeper into the technical differentiators. We took a lot away from the meeting. 

Ahead of the meeting with Sportsbet next week we thought we'd send through a brief to ensure we're all aligned. 

There are a few other things that we'd like to work on with you ahead of the meeting. These are:
Roles and responsibilities in the meeting
Christopher will open the meeting and shed light into the process we've undergone over the last 24 months to find the next best piece of technology and that we've excitedly landed on Beam.
Jonas will take the agenda points as it pertains to an overview of Beam, our differentiators, and demo of the platform.
Build the deck and demo
Jonas/Derya - if I get a detailed brief for the demo would you be able to build something bespoke to showcase in the meeting?
If you've got a first meeting deck that I can personalise for Sportsbet, please feel free to share it with me 
See below an overview of the information that we have, we're incredibly excited to get into this together.

Beam Briefing: Sportsbet Engagement
1. Summary of Info from Nick
Primary focus area right now:

Toby Barrett (Sportsbet) has been pulled from his content management role into a newly created “AI Secondment” role my Migs (CMO).

His mandate: drive operational efficiencies across Sportsbet’s entire marketing funnel (16 marketing departments, ~120 staff).

First scope is marketing processes (briefing media buys, approvals, content workflows) → low-hanging fruit, practical tasks.

Later potential: scale to broader areas (e.g., KYC, responsible gambling, sportsbook ops), but not in current scope.

Cost saving opportunity (future state):

KYC and Responsible Gambling are the two heaviest cost centres (~$18M annually). These represent major upside use cases for Beam longer term but not Toby’s immediate mandate.

Approach that will resonate with Toby:

Pragmatic, task-driven, hands-on demo rather than high-level visionary pitch. We should touch on why we've decided to bring Beam to market and then let them get into the platform as it seems like he's eager to get his hands dirty quickly. 

Focus on quick wins: show an agent solving a repetitive marketing task (e.g., material instructions for ad placements).

Clear USP vs competitors (Relevance, Make, n8n mentioned as alternatives).

Proof-of-value > slides. Land something working, then expand.

Internal dynamics:

Toby is detail-oriented and tactical, not vision-driven.

Nick expects Toby may ultimately report into him later this year, giving Nick more control. This is highly confidential so do not mention on the call.

Nick said that “This won’t be won in the boardroom, it’ll be won by getting shit done.”

2. Background on Sportsbet
Who they are:

Sportsbet is Australia’s largest online corporate bookmaker, owned by Flutter Entertainment (global gambling group).

HQ in Melbourne, founded 1993, acquired by Paddy Power (2010) and BetEasy (2020) , merged into Flutter.

How they make money:

Primary revenue: sports & racing wagering (fixed odds betting, multis, in-play betting).

Secondary: promotions, partnerships, brand media deals.

Operates on volume, marketed as a “fun, social betting” brand, heavy ad spend.

Market share:

Estimated 45–50% share of Australian online wagering (leading competitor is Entain, Ladbrokes/Neds, then Tabcorp).

Handles over $2 billion annually in turnover.

Challenges they face:

Regulation: tightening rules on gambling advertising, responsible gambling requirements, AML/KYC obligations. This is where the majority of their resources are getting pulled at the moment.

High compliance costs: KYC + responsible gambling = major cost centres (~$18M in resourcing).

Margin pressure: competitive promotions market, customer acquisition costs.

Operational complexity: Large-scale marketing machine with 16 departments and significant manual processes.

3. Stakeholders in the meeting
Nick Laidler (Head of MarTech):

Senior operator, understands both sportsbook and marketing efficiency levers.

Advocating for Beam but conscious of internal scoping, advises us to stay relevant and pragmatic with Toby.

He's a champion of ours and has been singing our praises internally. We've worked with Nick for the better part of the last 7 years.

Toby Barrett (Primary stakeholder):

Background: 7+ years running Sportsbet’s content platforms.

Current role: newly tasked with AI transformation currently focusing on the marketing function.

Mandate: Identify, pilot, and scale AI/agent use cases across marketing.

Style: Detail-oriented, practical, execution-first. Responds best to working demos, not high-level slides.
