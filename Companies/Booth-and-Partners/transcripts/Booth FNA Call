Speaker 1: Hello. Hello. Long time no see.
John Fong: Hey Quentin. How are you?
Speaker 1: I'm doing great. It's a lovely Thursday evening in Germany. It's not raining, which is good.
John Fong: It is a gray morning in Vancouver today.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're in Vancouver. I thought you're in sf. I think I'm mistaken. I thought you were on the west coast.
John Fong: Vancouver, yeah, Vancouver, technically.
Speaker 1: Yeah, technically you're right. Yes. Hey Suf, I Jon, as you might see a new face, I think you both never met, right?
Sufyaan Jogee: No, we haven't.
Speaker 1: Should we do. Should we do a quick intro then? Suf you want to kick it?
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah, let's do it. Hey John. Nice to meet you. So I'm also part of the go to market team at bim, but focusing predominantly on the HR and the recruitment space. So how we build these automated workflows. So being acquainted with Chad already. But yeah, looking forward to seeing the use case with yourself as well.
John Fong: Okay, cool. Excellent. I'm John Fong, CFO of Booth. Been with them for about, I don't know, like almost two years now. Previously had a lot of experiences in different industries in senior leadership levels. One whether it's healthcare, SaaS, tech or even mining. So you know, one of my goals or one of my wish lists or thinking about when I think about AI and finance is how do I build? How do it be great to have like a one person CFO accounting and have agents everywhere else?
Sufyaan Jogee: Yep, I, I echo that with every.
John Fong: Yeah, but obviously you know, we have currently in Booth, we have a team of 20 on our accounting and finance team. All great, just very doing things very old school, very manual. And I think there's a lot of opportunities here to see what we can do together. Ultimately if we can turn something that we can help solve a problem internally to turn that into a product that we can offer to our clients. Or even as a, we've been talking about accounting as a service for small, small medium sized businesses. You know, that'll be, that'll be something great too.
Speaker 1: Cool. So let's structure the call or let's set the scene by A, how we are going to approach this and then B, I think this is going to be a bit of an exploration discovery session for us to understand what are you guys doing, where are you thinking and where you guys want to go. And then also what are we already doing with our clients and where is our vision within this whole AI native accounting suite? I think the most productive thing to do is if I start explaining a bit how are we thinking about AI and accounting what do we see? Where are we going? And then you can comment. Take it from there and explain your take on that.
John Fong: Sure. Cool.
Speaker 1: I'll keep it on the voice level and then I'll show you something on the platform. So essentially what we as beam learned over the last one or two years, that everything we do always for some reason ends up in finance and accounting. The main value chains that we work in are essentially the whole order to cash flow. So we do the. I have a sales order, I want to confirm the sales order. I want to ultimately trigger an internal procurement. Then if I have delivered the sales order, we go from payables to receivables. So now I have an invoice that I want to get paid and then I ultimately create the invoice, I reconcile the invoice, I deliver the invoice, I remind people to pay me, I enter the dunning flow and then I end up in collections. Now along this journey we were always doing some work, some work either in sales, we were doing some work in accounting, we were doing some work in collections. And then roughly a year ago we kicked off our biggest client project which is one of the largest German debt collectors. What they do is they collect debt for high volume clients such as insurances, telco companies, everything where you have smaller to medium sized consumer debt and a high volume. Now with them we started automating the complete debt collection flow which is from. I have a dispute, I have something that I need to resolute. So in Germany it is like you can have installment plans, you can have. What is the English transfer English word if I go bankrupt? Insolvency. You have insolvency flows. So there are different categories of types of flows that we build for them. That's an internal debt collection department. This turns up to be a volume of 69 agents replacing AD FTE, incurring into 3.6 million cost center that we replaced for them. This is the big collections case. This is our biggest achievement so far. Now from collections for us, it was then very instinctively logical to go upstream in this value chain and start looking into dunning and then start looking into reminders. And now you see, I trickle back the order to cash flow up until the order again. And this is essentially what we are building now. So we within the order to cash or accounts payable receivables flow, you will always find these friction moments like reconciling an invoice where currently human beings are sitting there and doing nothing else. We're currently. So we won another big client In Europe this month, which is Zurich Insurance, this is one of the largest European insurers. What they do, they have 200 analysts doing nothing else than reconciling invoices for all of their global insurance entities. It is ridiculous. 200 people either in Europe soil or on Europe soil with Europe salaries. Or they have a BPO in India who they outsource this to. I think that is actually Infosys, one of the largest BPOs, which they outsource to. And then it's again a full cycle, full cycle moment because we serve Zurich as an incline. But then there's also a BPO involved. And now I know I come to the bridge where I start. I think it starts making sense for us in this collaboration. If you are, if you are hiring people to do these roles for your clients that we already replace for a bunch of these clients, I think that's where then the flywheel starts making sense. Now, before I open the room for discussion, let me quickly show you how this looks like and how are we already building this? And then feel free to comment and please, please ask as many questions as you might have.
John Fong: Sure.
Speaker 1: So you now see yourself for a second? I think so. And I have a million tabs open, so if I'm crashing, just scream. So what you're seeing right now is our platform. You see on the top left corner. We are not in a booth and partner space. We are now in one of our demo spaces for accounts receivables. In this space, I've mapped out the whole flow of AR in agents. So we start with invoice creation, we start with reconciliation. Then we have reminders, dunning and debt collection. These are the five friction points that we've identified so far with our customers. So if I now go into invoice creation, there is a flow behind this. This is now a very easy flow. And it's not that, not that mapped out completely because this is a demo. But you see, essentially the agent is working on tasks just like in your CV screening agent. We trigger the agent. In this case, it's a sales order. We have a bunch of valid path. Is it the right sales order? Is it the right customer, Is it the right tax number? And then ultimately generate the invoice in this case in SAP and flag this for review in Microsoft Teams. I have to say here, this is a demo space. So the SAP integration is mocked. This is not the real SAP integration because it's a nightmare of an API. But for very specific client projects, we then can pick out the right endpoints to enable these. And then if I go into reconciliation, which we've actually built with our partner IBM for their clients, is that in the end it's the same. You receive a data piece, you follow a process description and reconciliation flow, and you push something back, which in this case, we found some discrepancies in the payment. So we need to flag this for manual review. Maybe I pause here for a second to open the room for discussions or sue. Feel free to chip in if you have additional thoughts.
Sufyaan Jogee: No, it'll be in mind.
John Fong: Yeah, it all makes sense so far.
Speaker 1: Cool. Then please comment or feedback.
John Fong: So, on the order to cash side. Yes, it's, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty interesting, compelling. I'm looking at it at a lens on what do we need to. What problems we need to solve for Booth first. And right now we're going through a phase where we're going from a very manual invoicing process because it's really based on our current HRS and payroll system. We're moving away from that into another platform which will hopefully automate a lot of the invoicing issues. On our end. We don't know what that solution looks like yet. It could be a few different ways. But I do see that if it swings to a path where it's less automated than we thought, then I think there could be an opportunity here. We're still in the scoping phase right now. That's one comment 2. On the collection side, we don't, we don't have a lot of clients. We have probably about like 150 or so clients. They, I would say like 85, 90 of them pay on time. So collections is not really an issue for us. So I, I don't know if I see that as a real big pain point for us to solve with an agent at the moment. I do, I do. You know, if there's something that's on the procure to pay side, like that's something that's pretty interesting for, for me, I think from, from our end, it is a very manual process from the procurement side all the way to the payables and, and payments side of things. Yeah, things are done through email forms. Like a lot of human interaction, things back and forth. Even, even invoice input into the system. Very manual so forth. So that's another comment. Yeah, a third, a third comment is when I look at all the list of all the accounting roles that our clients have with us, I'm just looking at a list right now and it's just by titles. From what I see there's a lot of payables people like payables clerk, payables supervisors, less on the revenue side at the moment. So if I'm looking, if I now that I you know when I step back and take a look at where our pain points are internally where we need to solve them and the possibility of productizing that to help solve our clients problems, I'm seeing more on the procure to pay side than the ordered cash side.
Speaker 1: That's cool or interesting to know for the procure to pay side. The only thing I don't have a working demo space for you at hand right now but showing you my my working environment in notion. So in in payables we identified four agents so far that we see mostly with our clients. It's either the generating of the PO and chasing down pos is also something that we do. So for example one of our collaborations that we're playing around with right now is they need to chase the PO creation from big clients like Coca Cola and such on because they don't create a PO and then they sit there and wait to invoice. So this is one thing. So the PO generation and chasing and then we do have this whole receipt, invoice verification stuff, invoice approval, find the right cost center manager, find the right cost center number, book the invoice on the cost center and have it approved and then ultimately two and three way matching. And behind all of these agents. Oh, now my Apple watch starts screaming at me. And behind these agents we do have a fully mapped out flow which we're now going to build on demo agents. So we are about to take templatized this already to have basically the payable suite ready. It's generic, it's ready to demo, but it's not ready to use because ultimately every of your clients or let's say out of the 150 clients, let's say 60 of them would be available to approach with such offering. Out of these 60% there's going to be a bunch which have very different system, very different flows and we need additional going to be a bit of a customized solution anyway. So coming back to what you're saying, I was showing you receivables because that's what we do most and what we what we've built in the platform already but we're already working on procure to pay as well.
John Fong: Got it, got it. Yeah. So those are I guess you know, just based on what you've shown I think Those are the things that are coming up already. And we're just focusing on these two areas. I mean, it doesn't mean that there's not an opportunity to find an agent solution that helps solve our order to cash side of things. I think the big thing now is we're just in the middle of this transition to a new system, and we'll have to figure out what path that is. Once we've defined what that path is, then I'm more clear and say, okay, here are some opportunities. Let's sort of kind of dig into this area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I see. My thought on that is I think the finance and accounting opportunity for us is not within the client vendor relation Beam Booth. I think the bigger opportunity is actually within your own client base. And I think this is also where this whole discussion originated from, where Jamie said, hey, let's, can we not white label slash, resell this into our client base? So what we need to say, I think what we need to do. And so please chip in on this because you're the expert on these kind of things of systematically and data driven identify client needs. What we could do is essentially drill down that path that you started sketching. Find out the roles of your clients that are hiring payment to pay clerks. Find out the roles that are doing these jobs. What are the essential, what are the flows? What is the SOP that the human being is holding, what are the salaries that they hire for. And then we can start playing around with an offering which we could validate with one of your low priority slash smaller clients where we could test such a go to market approach. But please add to this.
Sufyaan Jogee: So the system that you're currently like going to attend the for, I imagine, or just a process to buy, do you know if that system is being used by some of your clients as well, for example?
John Fong: No. So we are. So we're transitioning all of our clients onto this platform.
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah. Are you able to share what that platform is?
John Fong: Deal.
Sufyaan Jogee: Deal. Okay.
Speaker 1: We use Deal as well, so. And Deal also has a very nice API.
John Fong: Yeah, yeah, they're, they're pretty open with that.
Sufyaan Jogee: I guess what I was trying to get at there is like, if you're, if you're looking into the procure to pay space and maybe that's a use case. Now if that system is also being used by some of the end clients that are recruiting for these roles, I think if we can initially prove internally it works for Booth, then you can take that to the end clients and be like, look, we've automated it for us internally, you're hiring for abc, who's also going to be doing the same role. Maybe you can cut that headcount by one less or you could actually just save the entire cost yourself as well. Why don't you let us deliver that for you?
John Fong: Yeah, and I think that's kind of what I'm thinking about. If we can test it on ourselves, use ourselves as the first client.
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah.
John Fong: Have a good use case. Case study and have some good proven data points, it'll be a lot easier to reach out to our existing clients and say, hey, you know, we solved this problem. I know you have these roles in AP side very similar to us. You know, we can help you save X amount of dollars.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see, I see that in my head, what I need for this. Or I think what, what we can do is if we have the profile of the roles that your customers are hiring, like how is this role looking? Like if you could provide us with some data pieces, obviously we are under NDA and the client relationship anyway, so that shouldn't, I personally think it shouldn't be a problem. So if you could give us a rough indication, who are these people that they're hiring in FNA and what are these roles looking like? And also, very importantly, we also need to start thinking about the business case. What is the salary? What do we actually then offer the client? How does this change booth business case? And how are you ideally going to offer this to also maximize your margin on these things? So this is then the next string that we need to do. So yes, validate that it works, build the case study. But then obviously one thing which we need to have a lot of conversations about, how is this actually work on a business case level?
John Fong: Yeah, I mean, for us, and this is, and I think this is where there's a philosophies that are, you know, come grinding together. One is that, you know, we know that AI is going to replace some, some roles, whatever, whatever that looks like. But also for us, you know, we also believe that there's, there is a place in the world where AI and human really, you know, come together and that's where the value comes. Now how do we sell that to, how do we sell that to clients? Don't, don't know yet at this point. You know, obviously if we provide them with an agentic solution, they would say, great, you know, we don't need this headcount anymore. Yeah, yeah, so I think so. So that's. So let me just one last point there. So that's the thing. But I think if we're to use agentic solutions internally for Booth, my. Our approach is to have this AI human working together where our team can not do the manual things and they are elevated to some point where they can oversee agents and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
John Fong: So, yeah, two things there, you made.
Sufyaan Jogee: A good point there as well, is like, how do we position that to the client? I think my assumption half the time is the client is actually already thinking of it. They just don't want to verbalize it into the open just in case it creates any echoes with the employees. So, I mean, one way is if we automate, if you guys automate your function internally for yourselves, I'm sure you've got like email marketing campaigns or whatever you send out to your clients. You could just slip it into a newsletter one day, be like, hey, look, we've just automated this finance function for us or something. And that might even just create a conversation for them to come to you and be like, can we replace these roles with your, with your automation that you've done?
John Fong: Right. I mean, one thing, one thing we've been. I've been thinking in my head and, you know, we've kind of talked about this chat internally as well, is I want to. I want to create a new business line within Booth, which is. And we're just calling it Accounting as a service right now. So if a small business doesn't have an internal accounting team or they maybe just have a bookkeeper, they're growing, they don't want to add headcount, they can come to us and we'll take care of their end to end accounting needs, from procure to pay order to cash, financial reporting and, and out spits like board reporting, management reporting, cash flow, all those kinds of things. Now usually you would have like a team of people. You have a controller, an AR person, AP person, and they take on like X amount of clients. So is there a world where we can build something that maybe you have like one controller that sort of oversees a lot of different agents and we can patch that. And I would like, I would love to package something like that as an offering to these businesses where it's. I don't know, I'm just making this up. A thousand dollars a month. You have one controller that is the expert in process financial reporting and so forth. And then you have agents working with the controller to automate all these other things for you. So in it. So as opposed to hiring three people that cost you $6,000 a month, you're hiring one expert and 10 agents for a thousand dollars a month and you get the same quality or even better output.
Speaker 1: I see the vision. I think that's definitely a vision which has an addressable market. I'm thinking is this the addressable market of Booth right now? Because from what you describe, I have the feeling this is more of an offering for smaller sized companies up until SME. Or would a bigger company also outsource accounting to you for example?
John Fong: So yeah, so it is a different market from our current. What we're currently addressing. Companies that outsource are bigger companies that need to outsource a certain department and a function within that department. So within procure to pay, they might. The whole procurity process, they want to outsource a billings specialist. So that's like a small piece of that. So what I'm thinking about this Booth as an AI accounting service is totally different. Focus more on maybe startup small businesses that are in series A, series B. Like that type of. That type of market. So again, very different. But I think this is just from my personal experience as well. You know, working with companies like that that I think that could, that can be a compelling new offering that we can.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Basically we are your customer. We are a small slash fast growing company. We're now 55 people. We're fully running on deal. Deal gives you the best foot in the door to sell this to us. And I know that our. We don't even have a CFO and we don't really have an accounting person. We would love. We would love. I think we would love an offering like this.
John Fong: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The only issue that I see is the price point. I think for companies in that stage you can't. It's a thesis which we need to validate. But I think the, the actual contract sizes of 1,000amonth that you just threw, I know you threw a ballpark number into the room. It can be. It can also can be more. The question that I'm having in my head is if it then starts making sense to do this with an agentic solution. Because I mean these always also have a price point. Right? So there. My question is if the labor arbitrage is even if it's worth it, leveraging the. Or arbitraging the labor arbitrage. Do you get my thought on it? Yeah, yeah, that's. But that's a thesis which we need to validate because I think for starting scale ups, budgets are tight. I think they're not going to pay 4 to 5,000 for accounting as a service. Platform. They might, they might.
John Fong: Right.
Speaker 1: We need to validate. This is a thought. Okay, I understand.
John Fong: Yeah. So I think we're, we're, we're talking probably two different things.
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah.
John Fong: Right now. Right. So one is the an agentic solution that will help solve our issues internal needs but are able to solve our clients needs or clients or companies that are similar to our clients, larger clients, enterprise clients that have you know, a whole process that they want to reduce headcount but need have, have a agendic solution. So I think that's sort of one path. The other path, what I'm talking about is probably more like small medium sized companies. And Quentin, you know you make a really great point. You know startups are, you know, tight on cash. You know, are they willing to spend a thousand dollars a month for something like this? I think there's a world that, I think there's a world where it, it can happen. It just depends that at what scale those companies are, are in and what is the pain point around that. You know I would say seed to series A, maybe not I would say series A, Series B. That's when, that's when numbers get a little bit more high stakes board requirements are higher, you're getting more A higher caliber investors. You're getting kind of product market fit validation. So you're scaling to move quickly. I think I'm sort of seeing that series B series C companies as, as a possibility.
Speaker 1: I agree. No, I see the point and I see these two paths and I do see very valuable go to market opportunity in both these paths. I'm juggling the question in my head like how to best take this. So I think the journey is that we sketched out is yeah, let's try to validate it internally and sell the case study to your clients plus also position a new offering on the market for that I think we need to be very sure. What are these roles in each go to market playbooks? How would this suite look like and how are the processes working? What are the top tools that they use in these kind of flows? And I mean I think we just need to start building and then prove it.
John Fong: Yeah, sorry.
Sufyaan Jogee: Well, I was just going to say one thing, John. How much have you, how much time have you spent put in sort of the ideas and your head to paper on this and just planning out workflows and scenarios etc. Has that, have you mapped that out yet or is it still kind of sitting inside?
John Fong: It is inside my head.
Sufyaan Jogee: No, I know. Yeah.
John Fong: We basically came out a three day, a three Day strategy session yesterday. Yeah, I mean, like, bits and pieces of it. We've been talking about, you know, Chad, you know, we've been talking about certain areas. I've been thinking about certain areas. And then. Yes. The past three days instead of it kind of all came together.
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah.
John Fong: But, you know, maybe, maybe parking the, the all in one accounting solution aside, we'll park that aside for now and focus on, you know, how. How do we solve a problem for myself and Booth first?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
John Fong: And I think that could, that could be the easiest thing because again, we have clients that have similar roles that, that we've. That they've hired us for. So if we can solve something internally for, for myself and my team and we can sort of take that to our clients, I think that that's probably the easiest path. The other one is still unknown. It's a whole new business line for us. I think we have time to figure out what that could look like. But to solve an immediate need and that we can go to market quicker with our existing clients, I think solving our own problem would probably be the first path.
Speaker 1: I think we're also going to learn a lot if we start by that and then things will naturally evolve. So for you, I think you want to say something.
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah, I was just going to say so, like, I think that's a great point. I was, I was going to allude to that. So I'm glad you've said that. And I think one thing that we can maybe do is we did it previously with the recruitment team is we just sat down on a Miro and it pretty much follows the framework of like the business model canvas. But you kind of just mix it up a little bit to go from zero to one. And maybe something like that might also help to figure out what that one actual pain point is for you.
John Fong: Right.
Sufyaan Jogee: And then we can work backwards from there and try and figure out what that is. Maybe procurement one, audit, cash, etc. It could be anything.
Speaker 1: Right.
John Fong: Right.
Sufyaan Jogee: And then we can start from there.
John Fong: Okay. What I've been. So we've recently hired a new controller. During her onboarding, I asked her, take as many notes as you can about understanding the various processes in our company. So I can get a procure to obviously what she's put together with a procure to pay what our process is around that. And then that can probably like a good asset to start, like poking at things too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really good. Every. Every material or every data piece that you have, just throw it over the fence. Plus, I think the next logical step, what we should do is, Chad, you might remember this nice whiteboard session that we did once with the team. I think we should utilize your brain, John, to do the exact same thing. So what, what we can do, we will prepare a little session. It's going to be 45 minutes to an hour max where we have, we have a framework for how we deconstruct these processes. And then we're going to learn a lot from that because that's also how we learned about these seven agents which we are now currently building a recruiting in your recruiting department. Yeah. Then we're going to have a long list of agents and then we're going to dive deep into the most priority ones and then we could start building them for you and you start seeing the value and from there we can then take the learnings and maybe poke the first client.
John Fong: Okay. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Chad Chambers: Also, like, the idea too, of like, maybe this is something I can take on as well is like we kind of talked about it a little bit earlier. It's like all of those common roles that we have for our clients, like really kind of fleshing out their JDs and seeing what are the common execution friction points within those. Because then that will allow us to map that over to what you guys are doing or about to do. And then like. Cause I keep thinking of this concept of like really developing an ROI calculator around that and that will help us. I mean, this is beyond our internal pain points.
Speaker 1: Right.
Chad Chambers: This is when we started thinking about getting external. Like we can really start to map that out and that will show us the viability in some areas. Because like, to John's point too, it's like we don't ever want to lose that, that mentality of like that human data trust layer. I know I've preached about this before you guys, right. I was like, that's an area where we can play into. Right. It's like, yes, take some friction points of collections. Right. But maybe there's that human in the loop element for fraud detection or quality assurance or whatever that can bolt on.
Speaker 1: Top of some of these things.
Chad Chambers: So like we have that mindset as well.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You spark an interesting thought in my head with the jds. Do you think you could provide us with all of the open roles/JDS of these roles in finance and accounting that you ever had or currently have?
John Fong: Yeah, I think we can probably get that from the TA team.
Speaker 1: It's just roles, jds. So what are these roles and what are the job Descriptions of these. Then we can do our analysis, break it down. And then we also have a lot of clarity. And on the other hand, side, we also do the workshop stuff and try to extract everything from. You have what you have in your hat.
John Fong: Sure.
Speaker 1: And then we go from there.
John Fong: Okay. Okay, sounds good. If we're gonna do a workshop, I'm just looking at dates right now. It can't be next week because I'm getting a tooth extracted and I won't be able to talk. I say yeah, so I would say the earliest is like the week. I'd say the week of the 29th.
Sufyaan Jogee: I assume we. They haven't replicated an agent avatar on your behalf yet.
Chad Chambers: We actually were close to that yesterday. We've got like the way we want to get communicated to. I was like, I'm agent for that. Right?
John Fong: Yeah.
Sufyaan Jogee: Then it's 24. 7 access.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Sufyaan Jogee: Just send you a report when you wake up.
Speaker 1: That's great. Okay, then let's look in that week, it's. It's going to be an hour max. Sub and I are going to be prepare this. If you can provide us with the JDs and roles until then for us to prepare this as well, we can dissect this into an analysis. So I just look in su. In my calendar, we're pretty flexible in the evenings. Just tell us a day that works good for you and I'll send out an invite.
John Fong: So around this time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever. You can choose that week. I would say I'm okay. That would be good any day except.
Sufyaan Jogee: Tuesday works for me.
John Fong: Okay.
Sufyaan Jogee: Around this time.
John Fong: I mean, maybe we can just pick something now. I would say. Let's see.
Speaker 1: All right.
John Fong: What's, what's your. You're in Germany, right? So are you. So it's night time. So if I said, if I said Thursday the 2nd, 10 o' clock PST. So which is probably around like this time. Is that, is that, is that Thursday evening for you guys?
Speaker 1: Yes. So if you're. You're two hours ahead of me, right?
Sufyaan Jogee: Yeah, this time it's fine. Like the time we started the meeting tonight was okay. So.
John Fong: Yeah. So Thursday, Thursday, October 2nd, same time at Chad, Would that work for you?
Speaker 1: That'll work.
Sufyaan Jogee: Don't you want to bring your new financial controller as well?
John Fong: Maybe she's in, she's in the Philippines, so it'll be like 5 o' clock or 3 o' clock a.m. so what I can do is I can extract. I can get all the, all the notes and, and talking points.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
John Fong: And then. Yeah. We'll go from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
John Fong: And if there's any questions, if there's any follow up stuff I can, I can ask after. Yeah but I think at some point we'll have to. You know, when we go down this path it'll be great for you to chat with either our financial controller or even our, our AP manager.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So you should just got an invite for the 2nd of October same time I've blocked 1 1/2 hours. Please don't be overwhelmed by that. I think we're going to be quicker. But just so we have. So we have a bit of time. I'll send a quick debrief after this meeting of the action items until then and I think this is good. Can you guys do me a favor because we never touched base with on this with Jamie again after our call. So he said decently looked that we're making progress. I promised him a follow up. That's why so at least he knows that stuff is going on because he. I think he was interested in all of this.
John Fong: Okay Chad, I think that's.
Chad Chambers: Yeah, absolutely. I'll. I can definitely give him a touch base on that. But one of the things we were talking about is when we were going to meet up. Sorry, kind of.
Speaker 1: There's a dude he's going up. Some of you.
Chad Chambers: I was getting here the last conversation we had. Are you talking about the meetup between Jamie and us?
Speaker 1: No, I'm just generally saying I was just wanted to revalidate myself that he's kept in the loop because I told him that's the only thing.
Chad Chambers: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Just reassuring that I'm not people out. Cool. That sounds good. Okay then the workshop. I've planned it. It's going to be the second and things go from there. Very good.
