Speaker 1: Can you then partners have this agentic AI thing?
Speaker 2: Can you recall exactly what you said? Because I started a new recording.
Speaker 1: Okay, Right. So we could have. We should have spent more time getting to know John. What's his surname again?
Speaker 2: F O, N, G. So if you.
Speaker 1: Look, when you analyze John's history, he is a pretty hard hitting B2B SAS CFO. Right. He's doing it for Booth, but before this he's done it for a bunch of companies in the States. He is also an investor and he was also the CFO for a listed company in Texas where he raised $80 million in three years. So I think now he's at Booth, his angle. And if this is my assumption, purely on what I've gathered, he wants to build his accountant as a service software using AgentIC AI. But he wants to start off small and basically build a solution around one of his problems. Which sounds like it's the. What's the technical term? Procure to pay?
Speaker 2: It's procure to pay in order or invoice to cash. Technically, order to cash is the whole flow.
Speaker 1: So I. He wants to focus on procure to pay. If we can do that with him, he will probably then want to take that to the clients and sell that as well as a separate add on for Booth, which will bring them a different revenue stream. So over time, when he said he wants one finance function which is run by one person, we have a finance AI operating system.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is good. So, okay, good. How do we now ideally follow up for him to feel hurt?
Speaker 1: So the way we need to follow up is just extract the transcript around what he was talking about, his problem for procure to pay. Because that is what he wanted to focus on because he said order to cash. And the invoice one wasn't really that much of an issue. Whatever. His financial controller has also now jotted down for him. And then let's explore it in a workflow session like we did with the HR team to understand. Okay, so we need to run. So then we run this as a user discovery session. We're like, okay, what's your role? What do you do? What's the day to day? How do you interact with the system? How much time does it take you? And then we build a solution around that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, it's good. I will follow up. We have now a week to prepare, which is good.
Speaker 1: This is why this is good. Because you're hardcore sales and I'm not. So it's like I'll just figure out what needs to be Done. And then you just go and sell it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's why we're a good team.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly. Like I would need to Google this. Right?
Speaker 2: You dissected my personality.
Speaker 1: You remind me of. This is brilliant. It might. You might not get the humor because it's British again.
Speaker 2: Huh? You were having it then.
Speaker 1: It's quite British. But please watch it. I'm just neat here.
Speaker 2: Okay, I will, I will. You want me to watch it now or later?
Speaker 1: If you want. Yet.
Speaker 2: Okay. Give me a second.
Speaker 3: Hello there. Thanks for joining us here on Price Drop tv. My name is Marie and I tell you what, it's time for a fitness focus.
Speaker 1: Dad, calm down.
Speaker 4: It's life. I fat this up. I'll never work in this town again.
Speaker 3: Now we have got a special guest with us today and we'll be welcoming Terrence in very soon for us to.
Speaker 4: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Speaker 3: Come in and join us.
Speaker 1: All right. Is it.
Speaker 3: It is.
Speaker 4: Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Speaker 1: Which. Yeah.
Speaker 4: How are you?
Speaker 1: Hi.
Speaker 2: Terry's a super seller.
Speaker 3: You're gonna help us out today, I believe.
Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah. Gonna help you out with some. Which are cameras. I like to keep. Oh, you know, I do try.
Speaker 2: I love it. He's a machine, dude.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he is.
Speaker 2: I love it. Yeah, dude. I think naturally I just like to talk, but not in a bad way, but more in a excitable way. Yeah, it's excitable, but I. I think it's. It's a very good point. I never really pinned down what. What is it that makes it special slash what I'm good at. I think it's just being good in communicational skills with people with a certain charisma, exciting them. But also on the other hand, side dissecting the business case and the logic behind it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. But I will take this and then I will write the follow up. I'll run it by you for a quick review so you can look over it and then I'll send it today. We have one week to prepare the Myro and that should be easy. Maybe we. Maybe we could also use Dorian in that session if he's willing to.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, makes sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Or much. Exactly.
Speaker 1: I'll dig out some old workshops.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's good. And then we'll take it from there. This is good. This is the first step, man. It's going to be one of many.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is exactly. So just. Let's just focus on John, his problem and then let him figure out how he wants to sell it. And then he will come back to us and be like, right, this is how I want to do it. I want to use Beam as the orchestration layer. These are how the agents need to work. Right. Because you, we now need to see John as like the vertical expert for finance. So even for you, you should be extracting as much as you can from him like during his workshops. Because you can then go and replicate the procure to pay agent with every other company that's out there. Because, you know, you've been guided on that by a. I mean a veteran cfo.
Speaker 2: This is a great opportunity for us to learn.
Speaker 1: Exactly. Like, dude, he's been in the finance space since 1998. I don't think you were even born.
Speaker 2: 98 is the year I've been born.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Ridiculous.
Speaker 1: This guy was crunching numbers whilst you were in your pants.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I. I think so, yeah. This is ridiculous. Okay, this is good. All right, then let's have it then.
Speaker 1: Exactly. So John is your guy now. John is your best mate. The machine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. All right. You will do the follow up. I need to go to bed because I've got this on site meeting tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Do you want to look over it or you trust me on the follow up? Because I'm going to do it right now and need at least 20 minutes.
Speaker 1: Now you're good. I think you'll be fine. Just focus on John, focus on his problem for kids to pay. Let's do a workshop to go from his head to paper and then we'll try and build something around it using Booth for him.
Speaker 2: I'm going to now use the transcript of Booth. The transcript of our strategy alignment combined with my pre built workflow of follow ups with transcript and Cursor. It's going to dump me a best case transcript in a canvas that I can optimize and then I'll just push it to Gmail via the API and send it out.
Speaker 1: Can. Can Cursor perform actions on your behalf? So Claude, today I told it to open LinkedIn and navigate to my profile page and it did it for me. Can Cursor do that?
Speaker 2: Yes, it can. Yeah, I thought about it for a second, but yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you have to set it up right? It's not like a one click connector like Claude.
Speaker 2: I would need to look into it, but I think this is why I'm not.
Speaker 1: This is why I'm still on Claude, because I just like the ease of the connections. Just user friendly.
Speaker 2: I see why, but you have to. It is more user friendly. Yes, but you really need to spend some time with Cursor, because it's a super weapon.
Speaker 1: Dude, what is the most powerful mcp? Cursor's not even on here.
Speaker 2: Neither is Flood, but Cursor is also not an mcp. They're just the AI Coding tools behind it.
Speaker 1: So, okay.
