## ðŸŽ¯ KEY FINDINGS - JOHN FONG'S PROCURE-TO-PAY PROBLEMS

### Primary Pain Points Identified

#### 1. **Manual Procure-to-Pay Process**
- **Current State**: "Very manual process from the procurement side all the way to the payables and payments side of things"
- **Specific Issues**: 
  - Things done through email forms
  - A lot of human interaction, things back and forth
  - Even invoice input into the system is very manual
- **Impact**: Inefficient, time-consuming, error-prone

#### 2. **Client Role Analysis - Procure-to-Pay Focus**
- **Observation**: "When I look at all the list of all the accounting roles that our clients have with us, I'm just looking at a list right now and it's just by titles. From what I see there's a lot of payables people like payables clerk, payables supervisors, less on the revenue side at the moment"
- **Implication**: Booth's clients have more procure-to-pay pain than order-to-cash pain
- **Opportunity**: Focus on AP automation rather than AR automation

#### 3. **System Transition Context**
- **Current Challenge**: "We're going through a phase where we're going from a very manual invoicing process because it's really based on our current HRS and payroll system. We're moving away from that into another platform which will hopefully automate a lot of the invoicing issues"
- **New System**: Deal (same as Beam uses)
- **Status**: "We don't know what that solution looks like yet. It could be a few different ways"

## ðŸ’¡ STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### John's Vision: "One Person CFO + Agents Everywhere"
- **Goal**: "How do I build? How do it be great to have like a one person CFO accounting and have agents everywhere else?"
- **Current Team**: 20 people on accounting and finance team
- **Vision**: "AI and human really come together and that's where the value comes"

### Two-Path Strategy Identified

#### Path 1: Internal Automation â†’ Client Solution
- **Approach**: "If we can test it on ourselves, use ourselves as the first client"
- **Value Prop**: "We solved this problem. I know you have these roles in AP side very similar to us. We can help you save X amount of dollars"
- **Timeline**: Immediate - solve Booth's internal problems first

#### Path 2: "Accounting as a Service" for SMBs
- **Target Market**: "Startup small businesses that are in series A, series B"
- **Offering**: "A thousand dollars a month. You have one controller that is the expert in process financial reporting and so forth. And then you have agents working with the controller to automate all these other things for you"
- **Timeline**: Future - after internal automation proven
