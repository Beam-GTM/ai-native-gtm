## ðŸ”„ TWO-PATH STRATEGY EXECUTION

### Path 1: Internal Automation â†’ Client Solution (IMMEDIATE FOCUS)

#### Phase 1: Solve Booth's Internal Problems
**Timeline**: October - December 2025

**Week 1-2**: Workshop & Analysis
- October 2nd: Process deconstruction workshop
- Extract all procure-to-pay friction points
- Identify top 3-5 automation opportunities

**Week 3-6**: First Agent Development  
- Build highest-priority agent (likely PO generation/chasing)
- Test internally with Booth's processes
- Measure time savings and accuracy improvements

**Week 7-10**: Additional Agents & Integration
- Build remaining prioritized agents
- Integrate with Deal platform
- Create comprehensive automation suite

**Week 11-12**: Case Study Development
- Document ROI and time savings
- Create client-ready presentation
- Prepare pricing and service offering

#### Phase 2: Client Rollout
**Timeline**: January - March 2026

**Target Clients**: Booth's existing client base with similar procure-to-pay challenges
**Value Proposition**: "We solved this problem internally. We can help you save X amount of dollars"
**Approach**: Use Booth as proof point and case study

### Path 2: "Accounting as a Service" for SMBs (FUTURE OPPORTUNITY)

#### Target Market
- **Stage**: Series A/B companies
- **Size**: Growing companies needing accounting but not ready for full team

#### Service Model

- **Structure**: One controller + multiple agents
- **Value**: "As opposed to hiring three people that cost you $6,000 a month, you're hiring one expert and 10 agents for a thousand dollars a month"

#### Timeline
- **Research Phase**: Q1 2026 (after Path 1 proven)
- **Pilot Phase**: Q2 2026 (with 2-3 test companies)
- **Launch Phase**: Q3 2026 (full service offering)
