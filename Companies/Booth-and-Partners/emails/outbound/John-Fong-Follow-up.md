## Email Content

Hi John,

Great speaking with you yesterday! Thank you for taking the time to walk us through Booth's finance operations and your vision for AI-powered accounting automation.

## Key Takeaways from Our Discussion

I was particularly interested in your focus on **procure-to-pay automation** rather than order-to-cash. Your observation about your client base having "a lot of payables people like payables clerk, payables supervisors, less on the revenue side" really resonated with our experience - this is exactly the type of insight that shapes effective automation strategies.

Your vision of "one person CFO accounting with agents everywhere else" is compelling, and I think we can absolutely help you build that reality, starting with your internal processes.

## Workshop Confirmed: Thursday, October 2nd

**Time**: 10:00 AM PST (same time as yesterday's call)  
**Duration**: 1 hour (I've blocked 1.5 hours to ensure we have enough time)  
**Format**: Process deconstruction workshop using our proven framework  

### What We'll Cover

We'll use the same methodology that helped us identify 7 automation opportunities with your recruitment team. The session will focus on:

1. **Procure-to-Pay Process Mapping**: Deconstruct your current manual processes
2. **Pain Point Identification**: Identify the highest-friction areas
3. **Agent Opportunity Discovery**: Map specific automation opportunities
4. **Priority Ranking**: Focus on the highest-impact agents first

### Preparation Materials We Need

As discussed, it would be incredibly helpful if you could provide:

- **Controller's Process Notes**: The documentation your new controller created during onboarding
- **Client Role Data**: JDs for the finance and accounting roles your clients typically hire for
- **Current Process Flows**: Any existing documentation of your procure-to-pay processes

## Two-Path Strategy Discussion

I loved your two-path approach:

**Path 1 (Immediate)**: Solve Booth's internal procure-to-pay challenges first
- Use Booth as our first client
- Build case study and proven ROI
- Then take to your existing client base

**Path 2 (Future)**: "Accounting as a Service" for Series A/B companies
- One controller + multiple agents
- $1,000/month offering for growing companies
- Different market but complementary opportunity

Let's focus on Path 1 first - I think that's the smartest approach for validation and quick wins.

## Beam's Procure-to-Pay Experience

We've already identified four core agents in the procure-to-pay space:

1. **PO Generation & Chasing Agent** - Generate POs and chase down approvals from clients like Coca Cola
2. **Receipt & Invoice Verification Agent** - Three-way matching and discrepancy detection  
3. **Invoice Approval & Routing Agent** - Find right cost centers and route for approval
4. **Payment Processing Agent** - Handle approved payments and scheduling

These align well with your description of "things done through email forms, a lot of human interaction, things back and forth, even invoice input into the system is very manual."

## Next Steps

1. **This Week**: I'll send you our process deconstruction framework so you can review it beforehand
2. **October 2nd**: We'll run the workshop and identify your highest-priority automation opportunities
3. **Post-Workshop**: We'll build your first agent and start seeing immediate value

## Business Case Development

As we discussed, we'll also need to work through the business case details:
- **ROI Calculation**: How much can Booth save with automation?
- **Client Pricing**: How do you want to offer this to your existing clients?
- **Margin Optimization**: How can you maximize revenue from this new service line?

Your experience across healthcare, SaaS, tech, and mining gives you incredible insight into what works across industries - I'm excited to leverage that expertise.

## Deal Integration

Since you're transitioning to Deal (same system we use), we can leverage the API integration work we've already done. This should accelerate the development timeline significantly.

Looking forward to our workshop on October 2nd! Please let me know if you need any clarification on the preparation materials or if you have any questions about our approach.

Best regards,

**P.S.** - I'll also send a quick update to Jamie to keep him in the loop on our progress, as promised.
