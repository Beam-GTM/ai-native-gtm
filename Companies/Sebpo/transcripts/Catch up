Quentin Silvestro: Hello? Hello?
Speaker 2: Hi, Quentin.
Quentin Silvestro: How is it going today? Nice to meet you. Can you hear me? Are you there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Quentin Silvestro: There you go. I see Brett also joined. That's great.
Brad Kelly: So.
Quentin Silvestro: But are you. I just checked. Are you based at the Philippines? Micah?
Speaker 2: I'm based here in the Philippines, but I work est, so I don't worry about my schedule.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, that's what I was wondering.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's night time here. Night, certainly.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. It's a couple of our BPO clients. They all were. How do you call it? Nocturnal, I think that's the word. Where you basically work through the night.
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I couldn't. Yeah, it's. Are you used to that or is it. You did that in your previous roles as well? Hey, Janelle, did you know. Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: What was your question?
Quentin Silvestro: Are you used to working through the night or did you do this in your previous roles as well, or is this now the first time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. I've always been working nighttime for two years now, I think. So I've gotten used to it and it's quite right. So I always say. I like night shift.
Quentin Silvestro: That's cool. Yeah, that's cool. Okay. So how you doing, Janelle?
Brad Kelly: Sorry, I think it's delay on my line. I think I just spoke over.
Quentin Silvestro: You're just interrupting everybody. Breath. No, I'm kidding. Great. Great to see you finally. Good to meet you. I think you've been debriefed by Janelle about our previous touch points and what we've talked about so far. So maybe let's use this time real quick to a formally introduce ourselves real quick so you know who we are and who you're actually talking to. And then we can jump right into the use case because I've looked, or we've looked at the all of the information that you provided. I have a bunch of questions to clarify. So I think we understood it, but us helps usually if you talk it through one more time and then we can confirm if what we understood is correct. How does it sound? Great.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sounds great.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. So I may start. My name is Quentin, one of the few early employees here at Beam Building, the commercial department here, together with my colleague Brett, who is here as well. I usually say my role within this company is building these agentic journeys. So back in the day, everybody was racing towards being a digital native company, and now we do foresee the same inflection point where it's the same question about how do we build an AI native company very fast, which means usually starting by implementing AI into their business processes. So I understand myself as a somehow a special role where I say, okay, it's a positioning the project but also understanding what the client needs and then taking your hand on this journey is usually what I say. But enough said about me. Brad, over to you.
Brad Kelly: Yeah. Hey, Micah, Nice, nice to meet you. I'm Brad. I am the go to market lead for North America. So tasked with the same mission as Brenton, trying to grow this business over here, working with our active clients over here and making sure that everything's a success. So I'm great to speak with you today. Excited to see what we can do with Sebpo. I know we've been speaking about a few different use cases, but looking forward to digging into this one today and understanding it a little better.
Speaker 4: Last time we chatted it was really about we were squarely focused on finance, on customer support data because we knew out of all of our different service categories and capabilities, those three are the ones that were the weakest at and we really took it from a perspective of we'd like to be fed up, but we basically also always need to basically respond to customer needs. And we're hearing a lot. The majority of our repetitive work is actually more on the ad ops side, programmatic side. And while we really need to beef up those three and be more proactive, we need to be reactive first. Which is why we're really focused on that we need to square up and really fix up of the bottlenecks and some of the inefficiencies that we're seeing on the ad up side with AI with automation. And so that's why we're really we've shifted our focus and that's why we're just focused on screenshot automation. And there's a few other things on the advertising side as well that we really need to shore up for our clients.
Quentin Silvestro: Makes sense. Understood. I think for us in the end it doesn't really matter. Maybe for you also maika to as a quick kind introduction and how many collateral or how much collateral you sell from us in the end we're building this agentic platform on top of which you can start building AI agents which necessarily are for us human like workers. Think of this as being your little intern that is getting onboarded to your team and you can just configure your intern as you like it. Ideally you just give it an SOP and it will start working on that. Obvious, not that easy dumping an SOP and the agent starts working is not the true reality. Also happy to jump jump into the platform at the end of this call to actually, actually show you how it looks like or setting up a space for Sepulch prior to the call. So there's already an agent that does more or less what you provided us with information with and then dive deeper. So this is a quick intro. Now speaking of the actual use case, you would do us a great favor if in your own words you could really, really short rehearse the screenshot automation. How would you describe it? I've been to the sop, I've looked at the flowcharts and I've looked at all of the videos. So I've been through all of the documentation and I've also looked at your requirements doc. That was the business requirements doc for Snap Fi Snap fee. So I'm pretty well aware. But I have a bit different paths. On the one hand side I saw videos on the one hand side. On the other hand side it was about calling a Python based API. Maybe you can really quick talk us through and I can ask. Or we can ask our question questions if we really understood what you put.
Speaker 4: Into text or you want me to take this. Micah, Sorry, yeah, you got caught off. Yeah. Do you want to go through.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 4: Or do you want me to do it?
Speaker 2: I can, I can go through it and then anything you could add you can add after. So yeah, first. Well, a quick intro for me. I am the new global lead for process optimization and innovation. I'm barely a month old, but it's been great so far here and excited to potentially be working with you soon enough. The screenshot automation in a nutshell. Just a quick caveat though. So you received a documentation for our Paramount client. So it was built specifically originally for just one client. So that's why the documentation says Paramount, but generally because of the potential of such process to be also implemented with other clients. It's some sort of an offering that would like to also cater to our different clients. That's why what we're trying to look for in November is someone who's going to be a lot more agnostic and a lot more flexible when it comes to implementation and doing all these integration with different systems in schooling because different client, different requirements, but basically in general it would be the same process and the same service offering. So yes, for the screenshot automation. So basically it's literally what it is. It's taking the screenshot off of a platform or of a provided URL, whether it's from yeah, specific Paramount client or a YouTube video or whatever. It could also be coming From Facebook, Instagram, depending on the client means. And then it would take multiple screenshots of the pages in the video provided and then provide essentially the general output would be the PowerPoint presentation into different device format. But what we want is to have still the final decision would be the human would be the final creative decision maker where, okay, the AI or the app or tooling is going to be generating the PowerPoint presentation based on the screenshots provided by. Based on the screenshots selected. But there would be multiple screenshots options in there where the human could basically select from those. Is this better? This one has a logo. We prefer it on a wider view or with sex in it. So that's, that's the final creative decision making process that I'm talking about.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And also as I mentioned, it has to be agnostic where again it's going to be different, it's going to be different platforms. So it could be coming from Paramount, it could be cbs and then it could be coming from other clients as well and with their different, I don't know, toolings requirement. So we are generally Google platform company and most of our clients or a lot of our clients are also Google platform related ones. But other clients, especially bigger clients are, I'm not sure outside of Google. So we would want that to be agnostic as well, or at least flexible. And what we're looking for really is a very quick turnaround on the implementation because again, we're trying to be reactive as of now before we get proactive. So whatever we decide on or the client asked for, we want to be implemented as quickly as possible. Does that cover everything or.
Quentin Silvestro: Makes sense. Should I ask questions or. Janelle, do you want to add?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Janelle.
Speaker 4: Micah, you did a great job.
Quentin Silvestro: After months. That sounds great. Okay then, if I may, you basically answered a couple of my questions already, which means now this screenshot creation agent and ultimately building Google Slides as Please validate. If I double quest double ask questions, the human being would ultimately still be the final operator that's going to look at the result of the AI and approve. So there's a human and the loop step there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, understood. Now with different input formats, let's say the paramount example example was Salesforce. I think it's actually the easiest if I just pull up at my screen real quick because what I was doing before the call. I'll give you a full demo later. Just now look at this is the flow builder of our platform and what I did is just, I mocked the Paramount case. So The Paramount is pull new Salesforce cases, check if all of the requirements in there. Then I understood there's in the decision branch either you need to do creative work or you need to do platform work. I don't really understood that, but maybe we can double check and then ultimately we, we need to download the video, take the screenshot and create a Google Slide. So this is the 30% MVP version that I did in one and a half hours prior to the call. But now let's say we change Paramount, then it's not Salesforce anymore, but it's probably Microsoft Dynamics now. What this means for us is we would probably need to either build the agent in a very agnostic way where it's end to end so no matter what input format is the same output format, or we build 10, a subset of 10 different agents for your top 10 clients and you build the agent building talent in house so the person is actually able to adapt to the, to the changes and to the client clients that you need. Why am I saying this? In the end it doesn't matter. It's just a type of conceptual relation and how we are going to build this agent for you. It just matters because it's a decision if you want to build this expertise in house or not. I think it's maybe the question, maybe a question that I'm throwing over the fence like is it a plan to build a confidence center internally?
Speaker 2: I think on that note, I personally would prefer, I'm not sure about usernamel or the, the other teams, but I would personally prefer that we just get one solution for it instead of creating multiple for your clients. Because we have several clients.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's going to take you a lot more time to like create a custom fit for each client rather than just build one that's available for everyone else.
Speaker 4: Yeah, but it also depends though too on the time. Yeah, I, I can see different things play out. So it's more of. I'd love to see a proposal from you on. It's going to cost access to build this thing that we think is going to fit for a lot of our clients or it's going to cost y in this amount of time for what we know specifically will fit for Paramount. And then here's all these other versioning costs, if you will, and timelines as we can customize it per each one of these workflows.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, so this plays exactly into the direction where I was heading in my head because in the end, doesn't matter. We do not have big versioning Costs, it's just another agent in your platform that you need to maintain. So there's another effort for the actual maintenance of this agent. My recommendation, though, would be let's pick the top 10 clients and start a first little validation project together on the most important client. Show you the capabilities that work, validate us as a vendor, and then we start building the next agents. This is usually the most sane approach because agents. The second you start varying inputs and you use different systems and you actually consider this a funnel where you just throw everything in and you hope that it works, it starts getting difficult. So my recommendation would be to build very niche systems for your clients, which would ultimately mean more agents to build, but in the end, not really more effort or price. I think that's. That would be my recommendation. And, Brad, please chip in. I've been talking a lot.
Brad Kelly: Yeah, I think because the bulk of the work has been done right. The design of the agent is there. The configuration is 90% there. It's not going to be much of a difference in price to, as we say, deploy 10 agents rather than one agent. That is a capsule generalist. What you'd. Well, what the client might prefer as well is actually this story about you have your own customized agent, and we can configure that to exactly what you want to see. What do you want to see within the screenshots? What's the information you want to gather as well? And that's kind of what we also want to understand, because that was coming out of the call, we weren't sure if it was one agent we're talking about or multiple. We want to figure out what is looking to be captured within these screenshots. How do we make that happen? Ensure that happens as well? One is. I've got another question to follow. But, yeah, just to your point, Quentin, I think that would be the best way of doing it. Having individual agents for clients, bespoke, tailored, configured to their desires and needs. And then.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I agree. So to put a. Put a bottom line under this, my out of the hip recommendation would be to build multiple agents, because we've seen, especially with high volumes, they just work the best. The second we start getting hundreds or thousands of tasks a month, these systems can break if they're not built very, very well for a specific kind of input and output requirement. So this would be a recommendation B, heading towards the question you asked Brett. And please verify now in the scope of work or the document that you provided. I've read a Python API that takes the actual screenshots so you do have a system in place which does take the screenshots already. We just need to call and get. Or post and get. Right.
Speaker 2: It's, as I've mentioned in the email and in the documentation, I think it's already a project that's been started several months ago by an internal team. So they've built some sort of technology in it. And what they're saying is missing is just the AI tech. Okay, no, yeah, so they say there's HR connections. I'm really not 100% sure on that, but we can verify that in the coming. In the coming days. But yeah, so I think I've also mentioned. Okay, go ahead, Chanel.
Speaker 4: Yeah, and this team, one of our delivery centers, Bangladesh, they have worked on a lot of things for clients, but they've always done that. We need to perfect UI ux. They come from a creative background versus the technical and then they fit in the technical, but that's not always a good way. And are we as confident and this new tool's ability to do what's necessary? No, because we've had a lot of issues in the past where we've had to scrap it and then redevelop it. So it is definitely something that has been developed that's important for you guys to understand, but it may not be the right solution. And it's really a shell, if you will. Based on what I've seen, it can do some things based on our existing manual workflow. There is a little bit of tech inside of it, but it's not at the point where it needs to be.
Speaker 2: That's what we're going to be trying to evaluate where the central partnership is going to be, whether we're going to start with bespoke or it's still worth the continuation approach with what's already been built by the internal team.
Brad Kelly: Yeah, it would be. Yeah, it would be good for us to be able to, you know, see that as well in terms of where it's at and what stage of that development so we can understand what work needs to be done at our side if that is something that needs to be built from scratch again or redeveloped, because it's an important component within that workflow itself.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I think understanding, like what is it going to cost for us to basically augment existing versus just build from scratch, that's a lot of what ELT is looking for on what is the right approach here. Because to be honest, that team, they really, they are not willing to partner with someone externally. They think they can do Anything in house. They're looking to hire a lot of engineers to finish the project, but we just don't have a lot of confidence either that the approach is going to be correct either.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay.
Brad Kelly: This is an in house team or external team that you're using.
Speaker 4: In house.
Speaker 2: In house.
Brad Kelly: And what I'd love to understand is the scale of this business problem we're looking to solve here. Because you mentioned, obviously we spoke about Paramount in this particular use case, but you mentioned there's far more. How many executions tasks are you currently manually doing for Paramount on this basis? And what's the overall scope here as well, just so we can get an idea of the size of the agent itself.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of different videos that the team at Paramount is managing. If you talk about scale of future, we also have clients like NBC, Univision that we do the same work for. Out of our existing 37 clients, I would say at least 15. We do this work for today and we all need to do some augments to it now in terms of the actual volume, we can get those numbers for you. I don't have that off the tip of my tongue.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Jim is still. From the last meeting. Jim is preparing some sort of documentation on development volumetry based on what we.
Speaker 4: Internally.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: So provided within the week. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay. Just to tap into the topic before real quick. So I understood correctly. So ideally from what my gut feeling says, if there's not really that much conviction from your end that the team is doing that. Right. Plus if the team already says they're not really willing to work with a third party vendor, I have the feeling it can get difficult. So what I hear is you probably would want us to also propose where we bring the screenshotting solution just for. Just for information. We will need to still need to rely on third party APIs. So we do need to do a quick research on what the best vendor for this is. But in the end it's just calling and getting information and then putting it into a Google sheet. Cool. Okay. I think from my end mostly understood what I can say. And so we also double checked this with our agent engineers. Definitely a use case, which is feasible. I do think we, we have a couple of steps of going one level deeper into how is the actual infrastructure and orchestration going to look like? Are we going to build 10 agents? Are we going to build one big agent? And what systems are we using? But then I would be, I would be feeling comfortable to quote something like this. Yeah. Going forward.
Brad Kelly: Yeah. We definitely need an idea of. Sorry. We definitely need an idea of the amount of executions the agent would be doing for an individual client or on a whole, just so we can price that up for you guys as well.
Speaker 4: Makes sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I wanted to make sure that we're also clear on the path approach on this project because I mentioned that it's going to be the. We're going to be starting with the internal poc. Right. And then external and then the production. Okay.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, yeah, works for us. We usually like to do quick PoCs to validate each other and also validated. It works. And then we can scale this.
Brad Kelly: And what time frame would you be looking to monitor POC on? Because we can work to whatever it needs. If it needs to be four weeks, it needs to be three months.
Speaker 2: What do you have in mind yesterday?
Brad Kelly: Okay.
Speaker 4: Give you a little bit more historical context too. So about two years ago, we had a team of people who promised Paramount that we would work on a solution for them. And I've now been here eight months. I knew of this project, but it was always that's managed separately. That's not part of product and innovation recently because the team was at a standstill. They're like Janelle Takeover. So we literally took over two weeks ago and now Paramount keeps asking, where's the solution you promised two years ago?
Brad Kelly: Makes sense. Yeah. That's a tough position to be in, but. Okay, understood. Timeline's fairly urgent then. To say the least.
Quentin Silvestro: Good that we're quick, Brad. Speaking of which, Sorry if I keep asking questions. It's just important that we understand this, the external perspective. Now, if Paramount actively asks you for the solution for I assume you foresee them also using it or what is the external.
Speaker 4: So it's really important you understand sepo, we work as an extension of our clients team. So we have team of people working in Bangladesh and El Salvador who have Paramount email addresses.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay.
Speaker 4: And they do the workflow specifically for that client team. So we're building basically this tool for our teams who are SEPO employees that basically act like Paramount employees to do the work. Yeah, I understand.
Speaker 2: So there's literally a team of humans manually taking the screenshots and putting it in the PowerPoint presentation. Sending it over to the clients. Yeah, from the actual URL or platform.
Quentin Silvestro: I understand. Okay. So, okay, makes sense because I was watching all of the commercial videos from Paramount. It was actually funny. It was a Zaxby, so it was a target. It was great. Now then, very honest. And also for us, if we're going to quote and propose this, maybe you can share a little bit in what is this going to do to your business case or your business metrics with the client? Because I assume you're charging him on, on an hourly rate plus a premium for your services.
Speaker 4: We only do FTE pricing right now. We are evaluating the pricing models in the future as we really get into automation. I mean, this is really the first for running into it, but right now it's just an efficiency play in terms of are we actually getting to greater efficiency, are we able to get through a lot more of these screenshots of the workflow? You know, instead of a week, maybe we can get through it in a day. And that means also we can reallocate some of those employees to other high order tasks.
Brad Kelly: Makes sense. And so we can try and give a fair evaluation from our product team as to, you know, what speed we can work at and what that efficiency looks like. What is the current time frame for one of these executions there? For someone on the ground doing a screenshot manually populating the presentation, how long does it take on average per execution?
Speaker 4: Two hours. Like from what I've seen and Jim is getting the final numbers on this, but based on all the documentation that I've seen, it's like, you know, sometimes a two hour task, sometimes it's a day task, depending on how complex that presentation is and all the different screenshots that are necessary to pull it into.
Quentin Silvestro: I'm thinking a bit outside of the box, but for PoC, the internal one, from my perspective, it makes the most sense to start with one client. For example, let's take Paramount and then build something viable for them. What is the minimal viable prototype slash product that you need to see in order to feel comfortable out of this PoC? Because if this timeline is so ASAP or like so urgent, we can be fast. But the second we start integrating Salesforce and researching vendors that take screenshots. So I ideally would make this as small as possible for you to feel comfortable, go to the management and say, hey guys, we validated this, now let's really build it. So maybe you can share a couple of thoughts about this.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I mean from a Mike, I'll let you go after I speak. But from an internal proof of concept, you know, it's really about management because we've never had an external partner. I've done a lot of these projects, Mike has done a lot of these projects, but everyone else, they're not familiar with this. So this is also a proof point where we need to basically compare. Look, we can do this so much faster. We can do this so much better with an external partner. And when you compare it to our existing manual workflow, look, this is the amount of time and we're still able to achieve everything that the client is asking for. Yes, it's not perfect from an MVP for perspective, but we need to get it to that point before we can then engage with Paramount to say, yes, we have found a solution. And there's been a lot of conversations I've had internally, too. We should never do what we did before. Of the yes, let's promise something before we even have a solution. But until we basically feel really good about your solution, then we're going to share with Paramount. Oh, by the way, we have found something and now we want to test it with you.
Quentin Silvestro: You.
Speaker 4: And that'll be that second test. And then once we validate it with them, that they find value in it, then we can basically finish it up and then we can launch it.
Brad Kelly: And one last thing for me, clarify just back what we said there. So this process that we're talking about, the screenshot execution, this isn't currently being done manually or so I'm just confused. So is this being done for Paramite right now or is it being on ice until we have an automated solution? Because it's not.
Speaker 4: There is no automated solution that is currently in the workflow for Paramount. This is an existing job that we do for Paramount and NBC and Univision and other clients. This automation tool that they've been working on for two years is not part of the existing workflow.
Brad Kelly: I see. So it's just been promised that the automation will be there. It's not there. We need it.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, okay, understood. Okay, then let's talk next steps, as this is quite urgent. I see we're at the end of August, so allow us one or two days to really dig into this case one level deeper. Come. Come back to you with a proposal like, what is the solution that we propose? What is also the scope that we propose? We might. We might be changing the scope from your business requirements document a bit, Micah. So it might be that we downscope it just for pace. And then I would feel comfortable saying we can present you a proposal by the end of the week, early next week, which is then September. And if we all aligned on this, we can start the collaboration mid September. How's that sound? Are. How's the procurement cycle looking, Janelle? Can we move fast or do we need to walk through procurement processes with data compliance and Whatsoever.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I mean there is a list of questions that I seen. Yeah, yeah. So as long as you answer that you will suffice from an IT perspective and a security. You guys have already signed our MNDA in terms of, you know, really us onboarding you. That's going to take very day process Max. It's really more of us aligning on do you have the right solution at the right price and the right timeline And I have weekly meetings with elt. I'll be able to even get an ad hoc meeting on this as well. So be able to move really fast because they want to move really fast. So I'm not worried about that Isn't going to be like a month long out. We need to evaluate all the potential.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Cool.
Speaker 2: And I also want to emphasize that the, the focus of the project is okay, we're trying to finish the screenshot Automations project but also this is the, the baby project where we're testing the waters for automation. Yeah, that's why it's. This is our proof of concept that we are actually ready for automation or at least how we're testing our maturity for any future projects as well.
Quentin Silvestro: That's cool. Okay, exciting. All right then Brett, any open last points?
Brad Kelly: No, I think that's great. I think that's the way we're viewing it as well that we want a broader partnership with Sebco. That's the end goal. I think here you're looking for an automated automation partner, we're looking for a BPO partner such as yourself. Add value across different business lines. This isn't a standard use case for us, but I'm still sure it's one that will nail. We've spoken a lot about different areas of businesses like CS finance which we can do. But yeah, let's take this away. Let's have a look at it with our solutions team. Let's scope this out and yeah, if you guys could get across just the volumes of executions that would be really useful. Then we can start having a look at what we can do on the consumption levels for you guys and try and map out what route to take from a centralized agent for all clients or individual bespoke agents for individual clients.
Quentin Silvestro: Allow us one or two days. Don't worry, we will be quick and then we will probably get you back into a call for the next proposal, the presentation stuff and then we can put a pin into this. Cool, thank you.
Speaker 4: Sounds good.
Quentin Silvestro: Bye. Bye.
Speaker 2: Thanks everyone.
Brad Kelly: Nice to meet you. Thanks.
Quentin Silvestro: My guy. What are we feeling? Are you there? I cannot hear You.
Brad Kelly: Yeah, my phone was headset so I turn that off.
Brad Kelly: Otherwise anyone calls me on it's.
Quentin Silvestro: I think you're not connected to your, to your MacBook with the microphone but I can still hear you. It's just like you're speaking through a toaster.
Brad Kelly: I'm connected. Should be. Was it bad on the call? Could you guys hear me?
Quentin Silvestro: No, but it's bad now. That's why the call was great. Now it's bad.
Brad Kelly: Okay. It's going to be a lucrative one.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I think it's, I, I think it's, it's just uncertain and we don't know if we can do it. I'm thinking in my head right now.
Brad Kelly: So many tokens on all these screenshots. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: It's going to be ridiculous. It's going to be big. So I, I'm thinking like. So she never really said something against the 25k PoC. The question is if we now stick to this because if we reduce the scope to a very, very fast project we can also reduce price. I'm like, I'm like in the point of like just, let's just get.
Brad Kelly: We don't need, we don't, we don't.
Brad Kelly: Yeah.
Brad Kelly: I mean we can get the logo but also at the same time I don't think we need to touch the price. This is an absolute disaster for their account if they can't get automation in now. So like we know that their balls are in a vice so like it's, we just stick with the price. Like they're not gonna fluff up, fluff up with that. The issue comes with the consumption pricing for us because well it's not an issue because it's still gonna be scalable for them. It's gonna be way cheaper than having, you know, 15 Indian members running through this. Even if it, even if it's a top tier pricing. So I don't think it's just pricing because they're balls are in advice. They need the solution done asap. If we can do it, let's do it. The tokens, they're gonna have to be on a maximum plan of tokens anyway because it's going to be about 30 tokens per execution. If they want to white label this or use Beam Agent to run at this stuff then they can do that too. I mean ultimately what we need to do is we need to make sure this plan or this pricing comes out to what we think a full time employee is going to be doing on it or four full time employees per account. So you know, if we can price this in under, I don't know, around 50k, an agent, maybe, Maybe more. Maybe more, to be honest. A year per end of it for like, for Paramount, for whoever, then it's going to be a bit of a no brainer for them.
Quentin Silvestro: This is good. This is really good. Did you look at this, by the way? This had me laughing. I don't know if you saw this, but there's like. This is Zaxby's commercial. Did you look at this? Do you see my screen mate?
Brad Kelly: Did you see that? They're censoring Trump.
Quentin Silvestro: Really?
Brad Kelly: Dude, it's in the first. It's like in the rules. It's like don't, don't ever make Zachary's.
Brad Kelly: Giant chicken finger quesadillas. So giant crispy fingers, sauce and melty cheese.
Quentin Silvestro: This is XP's commercial. I've been to Zaxby's last week or like two weeks ago.
Brad Kelly: All right.
Quentin Silvestro: The best.
Brad Kelly: I've never, I've never been. Yeah, look at this. Look, look at it. Go back on that one copy of Do's and Don'ts. Look there. Perform inspection to ensure no Trump related content is included.
Quentin Silvestro: Oh, sick. Oh, that's crazy.
Brad Kelly: That's crazy.
Quentin Silvestro: How did you like that? I quickly spun up an agent with a workspace for them. Huh? I did this. I did this 10 minutes before the call.
Brad Kelly: You shouldn't tell them how long that takes either you like this. Took me an hour. Now it takes me, you know, whatever I know. But yeah, no, I like that. Look, I think there's something here. If we can get solutions on board.
Quentin Silvestro: Solutions?
Brad Kelly: No, but we just need an idea on executions.
