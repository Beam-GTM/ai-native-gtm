Quentin Silvestro: How's it going? Life is good. We're in rainy Berlin today. So Brad is in. You're in France, right, Brad?
Brad Kelly: Yes, I'm in France.
Quentin Silvestro: Looks sunny where you are.
Speaker 3: Hello, everybody.
Quentin Silvestro: Hey, James. Shining through the clouds.
Brad Kelly: Hey, James.
Quentin Silvestro: Nice to meet you.
Speaker 4: Hey, Jim.
Speaker 3: Pleasure.
Speaker 4: How was your day, James?
Speaker 3: Very nice, but a lot of time outside.
Speaker 4: And it wasn't Monday too, so it probably was the best holiday.
Brad Kelly: That's awesome. Where do you spend your labor days, James?
Speaker 3: I'm here in Wilmington, Delaware, so we have a lot of hilly and mountainous areas where we can do hiking. So pretty much we're out every day. Hiking.
Brad Kelly: That's awesome.
Quentin Silvestro: That's cool.
Brad Kelly: I've been down to Dewey beach once.
Speaker 3: Never made it to the beach. He's a Jersey beach guy.
Brad Kelly: Oh, nice. Okay. Yeah, I. I love getting down the shore when it's possible, but yeah, this weekend in France. But yeah, I love the shore and.
Speaker 3: My parents live down the Jersey shore, so that's where I go all the time.
Brad Kelly: Oh, cool.
Quentin Silvestro: Great. Okay. Micah, we brought in Bennet. He's actually sitting right across me. I think you can also. I think he just joined. Ben is our cpo, so he knows everything about the product and what we can do and what we cannot do. So I think we have the right people here in this call together. Also with you, James. Nice to meet you.
Speaker 3: Please.
Quentin Silvestro: That's cool. Should we do a very, very, very short round of introduction so you actually know who we are before we jump right in? I'll start as I'm already speaking Quentin, together here with the beam team started building the commercial unit and expanding this to North America right now with Bre where we're also attending obviously a couple of events and where we met Janelle, I think this was now roughly six to seven months ago. Right, Brad? Exactly. On the shared service and outsourcing event. Since then, iterating on how could we collaborate and actually start building agentic workflows. And now ultimately with Maika joining, coming to Screenshot Automations. But before we jump into Screenshot Automations, Brett, do you want to share a couple sentences and then. And maybe you can also introduce yourself real quick?
Brad Kelly: Yeah. Short and sweet from my side. I'm the ghost market lead for North America, working with Quentin, like you said, expanding our operations there. And I've met with Janelle and a couple of your C level guys over the last few months and it's been really interesting learning about your business. And yeah, very excited to see what we can do here adding some value to automate the ad ops campaigns.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. Benny, I think we can hear you. I'm unmuted. We're sitting in one room. That's why we have some microphone issues.
Brad Kelly: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Hi, I'm Benny. I'm one of the founders of Beam. And yeah, the product is my crime. So yeah, these guys try to sell my crime. Yeah. Happy to meet you guys. And yeah, excited to discuss your use case a bit.
Brad Kelly: Cool if I make Quentin. I might suggest when Bennett is speaking if you guys just swap mics entirely because that was quite low on the volume scale.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay. He comes over to me.
Brad Kelly: Okay.
Quentin Silvestro: Was it audible so you could hear me better now?
Brad Kelly: That's a lot better.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 3: Thank you.
Quentin Silvestro: So Benny just shared that it's his crime what we're trying to sell here now jokes. Okay, James, you want to kick it off real quick?
Speaker 3: Of course. Like I said, my name is Jim Batista, CEO of Creative Services. I am responsible for all things technical services and creative services. So DevOps software development. I'm also responsible for onboarding, implementing and daily management of our teams here within my department. So with this as well too, I've been working on a lot of the innovation projects. I am a designer, front end developer by trade and back end. I know enough to be dangerous.
Speaker 4: I love it with that notice even being modest with that because he's one of the pioneers for satpo and one of those very few individuals who has his just first name as his email address. If you would notice, that's her gym and I am Micah. Quinton and Brad met before. Nice to meet you Bennett. I am fairly new so I'm only starting two months on the 21st I think but I am.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay. I think. Sorry, we. The connection was gone for a second but I think we're back.
Speaker 4: Can we. I think Penton is a bit frozen. Yes, you can see verify.
Brad Kelly: Yes, that's what I'm picking up as well.
Speaker 4: So while we're waiting for Kitten's video, our agenda for today is basically more so tech discovery. Right. That's why we have to here. He's basically our technical expert. Everything about screenshot automation, although he's technically just absorbed it from another team. But he is basically the in house expert now since he's done from. He's done it from the.
