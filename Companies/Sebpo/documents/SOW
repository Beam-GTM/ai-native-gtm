Appendix 1) Proposal & Scope of work
Proposal: Automating your business processes with Autonomous AI Agents
Context
This proposal introduces an AI-driven solution for SEBPO to automate screenshotting. 
At A Glance
Automated Solution with Autonomous Agents
Includes joint development of two agents and access for SEBPO to the Beam platform.
Roadmap to success
Project Kick-off and Platform Setup
Provisioning of the Beam platform for SEBPO
Kick-off to define automation requirements for the use case
Gap analysis and Integration concept
Providing access and basic training to the team
Support and Agent Development
Co-Development of the AI Agents to automate use-cases
Evaluation and continuous improvement of agent performance
Integration
Integration with the client's internal platforms for seamless operation
In-Scope (POC – Single Client)
The Proof of Concept (POC) will focus on one client, implementing and validating two automated workflows with their respective requirements and infrastructure:
Workflow A — Video Screenshots
Receive API call with payload: Task, Client, Video URL, and Requirements
Parse and analyze task requirements
Analyse Sample frames from the video and generate textual descriptors. 
Use LLM-based reasoning to select the required number of best-fit frames.
Return results via callback, either timestamp or image assets and structured manifest.
Workflow B — Platform Screenshots
Receive API call with payload: Task, Client, Platform URL, Login details, and Requirements.
Navigate directly to the specified platform URL. (opt. Authenticate via provided credentials.)
Analyze requirements (categories, exclusions, framing).
Capture the requested screenshots (full-page or element-specific).
Return results via callback, including image assets and structured manifest.
Out of Scope
The following items are not included in the POC delivery and will require separate scoping for later phases:
Multi-client rollout: Support is limited to one client’s requirements and infrastructure; onboarding of additional clients is excluded.
Custom vision model training: No bespoke computer vision or model fine-tuning will be developed; the POC leverages existing models with rule- and prompt-based reasoning.
Complex authentication flows: Advanced login requirements such as multi-factor authentication, SSO integrations, or rotating tokens are not supported within the POC.
End-to-end client dashboarding: Client-facing interfaces (dashboards, reporting, analytics) beyond the delivery of screenshot assets and manifests are excluded.
Billing/finance modules: Integration into client invoicing, usage-based billing, or token accounting systems is not part of this POC.
Generalized platform coverage: Only the agreed test client’s environment and workflows are included; other platforms, sites, or categories will not be supported.

Post-POC Outlook 
Future Collaboration & Long-term Partnership
Upon successful completion of the POC, Beam envisions a strategic partnership with SEBPO built on continuous development and optimization:
Service Contract & Continuous Development
Post-POC transition to a comprehensive service agreement covering platform licensing, maintenance, and support
Dedicated development resources for iterative improvements and new use case expansion
Quarterly business reviews to assess performance metrics and identify optimization opportunities
Scalability & Expansion Opportunities
Multi-client rollout support with customized configurations for different business requirements
Development of additional automation workflows beyond screenshotting. 
Integration capabilities with SEBPO's existing tech stack and future platform acquisitions
Partnership Benefits
Priority access to new Beam AI features and capabilities
Collaborative roadmap planning to align Beam's development with SEBPO's strategic objectives
Volume-based pricing advantages as usage scales across multiple clients and use cases
Commercials: Post-POC Partnership Structure
Following successful POC completion, Beam will conduct a collaborative workshop with SEBPO to define the comprehensive roadmap, scope additional use cases, and establish the commercial framework for ongoing partnership.
Pricing Structure
Our commercial model is built on two core pillars designed for scalability and predictable growth:
1) Platform Subscription & Usage
Monthly platform subscription: $3,990 USD
Includes standard token depot of 50,000 Beam Tokens
Beam Tokens represent our internal cost packaging for third-party services plus margin, providing a unified consumption model across all agents
All agents consume from the shared token depot, ensuring efficient resource utilization regardless of agent type or complexity
2) Agent Development Services
Development services charged at $200 USD per hour
Recommended approach: Fixed monthly retainer of 20-40 hours for the first year
Retainer model ensures smooth continuous agent development, accuracy training, and optimization cycles
Provides predictable budgeting while maintaining development momentum
Volume-Based Benefits
As partnership scales and volume metrics increase, Beam offers attractive volume-based discounts on both platform subscription and development services, ensuring cost optimization aligns with business growth.
This foundation POC serves as the cornerstone for a long-term automation partnership, enabling SEBPO to continuously enhance operational efficiency while maintaining competitive advantage in an evolving digital landscape.
Support
Beam will set up a joint communication channel (Slack) for direct customer support and fast issue resolution.
Client needs to provide API spec in a compatible format.
Client will need to support with API access/testing once Beam wants to test integrations.
Beam will support on setting up future use cases during the project phase.
Security Requirements
Beam AI will follow the SOC2 standard for security and data privacy. To ensure data protection and security, the following measures will be implemented:
Data Encryption: All sensitive data, including customer queries and product information, will be encrypted during transmission and storage.
Compliance: The agents will comply with relevant data protection regulations to safeguard customer privacy.
Access Controls: Granular login permissions will be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
Main Benefits of Beam
Rapid deployment of an operational MVP within 6 weeks, showcasing immediate efficiency gains
Minimal requirement for technical team involvement, facilitating an easy and efficient integration process
Scalability of the solution for future automation needs, further enhancing operational efficiency and offering quality
