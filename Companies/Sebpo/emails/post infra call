Hi Maica, 


Thank you again for the call today. We can confirm the agreed scope for the internal POC:

POC limited to one client with their requirements and infrastructure.

Two workflows in scope:

Video Screenshots

Platform Screenshots

Out-of-scope items clarified (multi-client rollout, dynamic navigation, custom vision models, production hardening, etc.).

Next steps:

We are waiting on the volume metrics for the full-scale external POC.

Once received, we will provide the full proposal for Internal & External POC ASAP.

If we finalize scope and contract by end of this week, we can kick off mid-September.

Looking forward to moving this forward quickly.


Best regards,
Quentin
