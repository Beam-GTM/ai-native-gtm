Hi Maica, 

Please find attached our proposal and Scope of Work for the internal POC. Following our session with Jim, we’ve finalized the scope and ensured alignment with the discussed requirements.

As we haven’t received details on volume metrics from you yet, the section related to post-POC pricing remains somewhat high-level. Once you provide an estimate or further input on volumes, we’ll be able to refine the pricing model and incorporate volume-based discounts accordingly.

Let’s aim to have a final discussion midweek (if needed) so we can wrap everything up by the end of the week. Your Forward Deployed AI Agent Engineer is fully briefed and ready to kick off with you on Monday, the 15th — we are ready to start. 

Best,
Quentin
