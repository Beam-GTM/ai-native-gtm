Speaker 1: It.
Quentin Silvestro: Hey Martin, how are you? I'm doing great. It's a lovely Monday morning in Hamburg, Germany. How about yourself?
Speaker 3: I'm in Surrey. In England. Yeah, just out of London.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, that's nice. How's the weather?
Speaker 3: Been to Hamburg a few times though.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Hamburg is, I would say the most beautiful city in all of Germany.
Speaker 3: Yeah, no, it's great. We're in the marine industry so we do a big show there every two years in September at the Messi.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, it's huge. Yeah, it's actually, I think it's one of the largest convention centers that Germany has to offer actually. It's big.
Speaker 3: Yeah, it's very big. There are a lot of steps.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, there are indeed a lot of steps. That's true. Lets do. As a thanks for coming or joining a call today, you would do me a great favor. You already mentioned marine industry. I did a bit of my homework. But if you could give me a rough introduction to yourself, the company and what you're most interested in, agentic automation, this would help me to then tailor the rest of the call towards your needs.
Speaker 3: Yeah, no problem. So River Trace are a manufacturing company based in Surrey in the uk. Excuse me, we've been. I'm Martin Songs, I'm the managing director. So we've been growing the business. I've been here for seven years, I think six years or seven years. We've sort of grown year on year and was looking to carry on growing but what that's doing is putting quite a big strain on the organization. Manufacturing is. Is quite a difficult thing because you obviously have to be good at a lot of different disciplines. So we export to basically shipping companies. So we make what are called oil and water analyzers. And most popular products are really used on ships to monitor the amount of oil that goes over when a discharge happens from a ship to make sure they're environmentally compliant. So we sell a lot of those, we sell a lot of spares, we have a lot of active parts, we have a lot of customers, which all equals a lot of noise. So we have primarily two systems that we use to manage all of the operations. One is HubSpot and the other one's called Odoo. I don't know if you know that one. Yeah, so I was, I was at the Odoo conference last week in Brussels. But what I'm obviously trying to do is to where possible, automate using AI. And I know not all of it is always used about using AI, but automate a lot of the processes. So one of the examples or use cases that I'm most interested in. Sorry, before I do that, we, we've put on, for example, a live chat bot on our website which is, is ring fenced with our knowledge base. So we're quite fortunate because over the years we have developed a lot of content and we're now able to utilize that from an AI perspective, say, sort of ring fence that information so you're not going out to the Internet. That's been really successful. What I want to try and do is then use that principle to apply to things like emails. So for example, we still get a lot of emails with orders, with inquiries, with, you know, I think you called it triage, which I thought was quite a good way of looking at it. And I wanted, I want to look at the ability to be able to automate a percentage of those emails. So for example, each of our, each of our devices when we send out has a calibration certificate.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: And every five years has to be recalibrated. What happens is a lot of these customers, although we've got a separate system to be able to do that, they'll come back, oh, I need a calibration certificate. So you go, okay, well who are you? What's your serial number? We then have to go onto our system, our other system, pull the calibration certificate or send it over. You might have two or three emails in an exchange. Now for me, if we had something that was integrated, for example, an API with our calibration portal, we could take that request, understand what it is, use AI to go and look it up, bring it back, send it over. So that's just one example, but that's the sort of use case that I'm after for agentic AI.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, this is good because you literally described what we do. Okay, that's very nice. Before I start introducing and sharing a couple thoughts, how deep are you in the rabbit hole of agentic AI?
Speaker 3: Whoa. I've, I've done a fair bit of research.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay.
Speaker 3: I'm no means an expert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 3: So I, I, for example, even yesterday I was trying to build something on nan.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: But obviously I like the idea of yours one because they kind of look like they were sort of pre built or done for you. So yeah, I'm kind of fairly good at the business consultancy side, but I'm not technical in terms of being able to write APIs. I like some of the things like NAN, because you don't have to be a coder. But yeah, it's, it's a bit of a DIY effort at the moment. And obviously there's a. There's a change management thing with the rest of the staff because everyone gets a bit scared when you start talking about AI agents and taking over jobs.
Quentin Silvestro: And all that stuff. Yeah, okay. Thanks for this introduction. Interesting that you already started working with N8N. It's essentially what you mentioned what makes us different. And a couple things more because we focus on not a DIY but more on a. We take your hand on this journey and help you automate all of these tasks. And we have all projects with us are always including one forward deployed engineer that's going to sit with you, map out all of the processes and it's going to ensure that everything is translated smoothly into our agents in the end. We like to think about agents as obviously kind of a human like worker. I usually like to refer to it as think. Think of me or the agent as being a little intern that you get into your department. How would you treat that intern? Probably you would give him a couple weeks to onboard him, show him what he needs to do, give him all of the access rights and then start training him to increase his accuracy or output in this end. And this is also what we are doing with these agents. So projects with beam are always, I would say maximum or no, let me start different. A minimum of four to 12 weeks in which the first four weeks are basically just understanding your process and mapping out the complete graph. Basically. Also sparing on is this really right that we do this? So we do a lot of task mining in the beginning. Sometimes we also identify. Okay, you're actually always doing this, but the flow right here would be making more sense. So it's a bit of we always a bit consultative in which we spar and help you build these agents in the first weeks. And then it's all about training the agent to increase accuracy. What we do is we try to focus on agents that are always 95, 97% accurate. You're never going to get 100. Humans are also never going to do 100. But this is the benchmark that we try to achieve. Essentially the cases you mentioned are the exact cases that we're doing. We usually operate within the value chain of order to cash. So I have an order that I want to get placed and ultimately then might need to create a po. I need to procure some stuff I want to buy or pay this po. This is then the accounts payables flow. Before it even becomes payables. It is the order confirmation order entry here a Lot of front office service. As you just mentioned, for example, the renewals of the certificates is something that sounds very interesting to us. And then after the second you have an invoice, you ultimately want this invoice to be paid. So you have the whole payment reminder dunning and collections flow. I don't know how what big of a volume these orders are in your organization. But then the whole AR thing becomes interesting as well. Maybe you want to comment that real quick.
Speaker 3: Yeah, around 100 orders a week.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 3: They Odoo have built in some element of AI for. When we use AI for. Sorry, Odoo for our accounts.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 3: So there, there are. We do do payment reminders and we do do some sort of. It's not fully AI reconciliation, but there's an element of it.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, Reconciliation is for example, one of the prime use cases that we do in AR with our clients. But you already mentioned a couple ones which make really. Which make a lot of sense to start with. So we are fully integratable with everything that has an API. With HubSpot and Odoo we both have a native integrator already. So it's just a single sign on into your ERP system and into your CRM. And then we can start interacting with these everything as for example this portal that you mentioned that we don't have because this is something you've built internally or is maybe very custom. As long as there is an API available, we can start enabling the. Okay, perfect. Then we can start enabling the actions. Coming back to the intern metaphor, as your intern would do it. So what we usually do, we start off with one process that we want to focus on. It then depends on if you want to build this competent center internally. And we want us to transfer knowledge to maybe young motivated individual that you have in the company or you want to treat us as your outsourced AI partner, then we can do all of the processes for you. Then it's ultimately just a matter of cost. Speaking of cost, commercials with Beam, we price based on two pillars. It's on the one hand side, as I mentioned, we have a very strong consultative kind of approach. We base every price based on time and material. So based on your flows that you want to automate with us, we're going to give you a proposal on how many hours we think that we need for this. Then you can sign off on the hours. So the first year is usually considered an investment that you're going to pay back ideally after nine to 12 months. And then the other component is fully Usage based. So as you know from other LLMs, we are also pricing based on tokens. What we do is we have internal API costs and also LLM costs that we basically transfer into a beam token with a small margin. Tokens are currently priced at 10 cents a token. Now just to give you an indication what this means, let's say your order processing flow or an email triage flow has seven steps. Seven steps equals seven tokens equals 70 cents. So the executions basically accumulate to give you a fair estimate on the ballpark figure you have to calculate with for the first year, I would say it's something around 1,000 to 2,000amonth for these flows that you were talking about. And then in the second year or whenever we are done, we stop the time and material retainer and that it's fully usage based. So you only pay for what you consume. So it's an investment that you need to make. But after the second we're done it's fully usage based and you can decide if you want to either keep investing in us as your partner or you want the knowledge in house.
Speaker 3: Okay, understood.
Quentin Silvestro: This is basically how we do it. I'm very confident that all of the flows that you described are something we can do fairly quick in I would say a three month sprint. This gives us enough room to set everything up and train your agents. You need to either, if you can do it now, show me what for example, how an order looks like, how diverse the products are. Because sometimes manufacturers, we have the problem that it's essentially just a big bouquet of flowers where this config can be very specific to this client and it might be tens of thousands of possibilities. So if you could maybe walk me through a flow or a process which is the biggest pain point for you right now that you would like to attack first, then I can after this call give you a customized proposal. You can sign off on the costs or we can also do a bitter big more of a detailed deep dive. We can also have some spare some time today for you actually showing you the product and how it works. So it's up to you. The only thing I need is a bit of a better understanding of the processes.
Speaker 3: Yeah, no problem. Well, if I show you that example, actually what I did, which I'll try and find on here is I.
Speaker 1: Oh, where is it?
Speaker 3: I can send it to you, but basically I, I sorry, can you see my screen?
Quentin Silvestro: I see your screen, yes.
Speaker 3: So what I did is we have on HubSpot, we have all of our.
Speaker 1: Oops.
Speaker 3: All of our Sales at River Trace emails go into the inbox. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Perfect.
Speaker 3: We also have remote support service pool tool. So we've got generic type emails that we advertise for different types of inquiries.
Quentin Silvestro: Perfect.
Speaker 3: The idea would be that you see Here we've got 33 emails open that the. Ultimately long term that the. There'll be some process that would be to categorize or analyze the email that's coming in.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: What you know, can this be processed by AI straight automation?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 3: So the example that I gave you would then mean, for example, a customer comes on into here and says I want my calibration certificate. There would need to be some sort of interaction to verify who that customer is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: I'm guessing maybe some sort of security, that kind of thing. So all of these customers should have access to our portal to be able to do it themselves. But they're sometimes lazy, sometimes unorganized, sometimes you know, just want to email. And every marine is very traditional. You get a lot of older people, they, they won't log on to new things and they just want to come back and get an email back with what they're asking for.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 3: So what we would do is, is do it on their behalf, which would be a case of an API and into River Trace Pool tool, which is this. And it would be a case of finding the. I need to remember how to do it myself now by finding the device. So all of the devices have unique serial numbers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, perfect.
Speaker 3: And then unique certificate numbers. And then it's a, it's a case of going in fact effectively replicating what I'm doing now. So downloading that certificate, sending that back to the customer. That's it. As an example. That's, that's one. But what I'll do is I'll send you. Because I did quite a lot of analysis. I uploaded 5,000 emails from sales at River Trace.
Speaker 1: Perfect.
Speaker 3: Into GPT.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: And. And I said basically analyze this with, with AI agents in mind and categorize them. So there's, there's, I can't remember at 4 or 5 kind of key categories, key use case workflows. And I'll send that to you as an example the type of things that we're looking for.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: But what it also has, I could probably send you the file because it has obviously all the wording and what we're being asked. I mean we probably. Do you sign NDAs with your customers if you want?
Quentin Silvestro: Yes, we can definitely sign an NDA. No worries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 3: I mean for what they're worth I mean, you know, I know this stuff's pretty. It's not really much use to anyone else, but it does have customers information, so it should be.
Quentin Silvestro: I'll send you.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Quentin Silvestro: I'll send you a mutual NDA template that we have right after this call.
Speaker 3: Brilliant. Okay. And. And that's it really for the first one. It's like, it's a case of looking at how many of these. I don't know, I'm just gonna look. These are all random.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 3: Yeah. So some of these are technical ones which would then go into the remote support. But as I said, remote support is a good example. So if I show you on our website. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: I did this, by the way, before our call.
Speaker 3: Oh, you did it. Okay.
Quentin Silvestro: I played around with this chat.
Speaker 3: Yeah. So what, what that's looking at is this. Oh, excuse.
Speaker 1: Me.
Speaker 3: So we've got all frequently asked questions on.
Speaker 1: Perfect.
Quentin Silvestro: And we can query this knowledge base.
Speaker 3: I assume query the knowledge base again. Yeah. If you look at what I did in HubSpot, as far as the where is it.
Quentin Silvestro: Perfect.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: So it's everything.
Speaker 3: So in here, obviously our knowledge base. But what I also did is to put in, you know, individual links. So you've got. Yeah. You've got different files, PDF files. We've got certain strange questions that have been asked once that we then give an answer to and we, we monitor this every week. And, and if there's anything that there's. That the AI wasn't able to answer, then we provide the data for it. But that's effectively what I'm looking for, is to be able to say, here's your knowledge source or sources.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: Did I put URLs in? Yeah, there you go. So I put in certain URLs from our website, not the whole website for the individual products, for example, and blog articles and things like that.
Quentin Silvestro: Perfect.
Speaker 3: And that's, that's what I loved about it. The fact that it's not going out to the whole Internet, it's going out to that restricted ring fenced knowledge source or sources. And like, say if we could then apply that to other areas like email management.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: Now, do you. How do you. With a, with a project like this, when you first start. Is it a case of that you could do it almost that AI suggests the answer, but someone has to go in and verify it before it's sent to the customer.
Quentin Silvestro: Those sort of things spot on. What we usually do. So the case you're describing is essentially one of the nicest cases to start because you do the email triage first. We basically triage all of your emails. We automatically give it the tag, ideally the top five that you already had an analysis on. And then based on the tag we can then define what happens with it. Either it is for example the certification flow where we call an API and then we send the certification back or it is just a customer service request where we send something, send a customer service answer back now based or a link to let's say one of these PDFs. Now within this, do we send something back, there's a guardrail which you can enable or disable. We call this human in the loop. So essentially one of your customer service reps or somebody that you have internally or even yourself, we just put a pre written draft or what we would have answered in your sales@rivertrace email inbox. And then a human being for the beginning of a project just needs to go to all of the drafts and see. Okay, yeah, approve, approve, approve. I know, yeah. Write something. And then we have this control feature in there. We usually do this for the first couple of weeks, let's say four to six. And then the good thing is that based on the human feedback, this is also what makes our agents better than other agents. For example we have a self learning component. So we feed this feedback back to the system and the agent gets better and he learns from your responses and what you change in the drafts.
Speaker 3: Yeah, brilliant.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Sorry.
Speaker 3: I love, I love the sound of it. And like I say, this is the sort of gap that I've been looking for because I've kind of got to got it to a point and also I don't have enough time. So. Yeah, you know, being able to outsource that would be, would be fantastic. The other thing I'd be keen to understand is on your. You mentioned you've got a consultative approach now. Whilst you obviously got, you know, other customers and other restrictions. It would be nice to understand other use cases that are making a big difference to let's say manufacturing companies, for example.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: That you would then share to say, you know, have you thought about X, Y and Z? So it's. Yeah, I'm really looking for it to be a two way relationship.
Quentin Silvestro: 100. This is also how we understand ourselves. I've mentioned at the beginning we, we think of ourselves as a strong partner that takes your hand on this journey. We know AI, you know your business and together we are basically trying to make the next step over a course of, let's say 12 months, for example. So yes, 100% just from our conversations right now. I think the biggest leverage you have internally is in customer service and internal sales. So the front office component and when we're done with the front office we usually move towards the back office which then comes into accounts payables and accounts receivables, basically typical financing flows or finance and accounting flows. And then we, we need to do a deep dive session and we always the first one open for a workshop or something like this where you walk us through you actually your core value proposition which is your production and what happens around this because we're no experts in that. So I usually after the first two low hanging fruits which is internal sales, front office and on the other hand side the finance and accounting usually then we start moving towards the more nitty gritty stuff which is actually a core value. This is the manufacturing part. So I think over the course of 12 months, realistically from what you've said, I think we could automate four to five, maybe six flows of these and I think this should already give you a lot of A efficiency and B, maybe let's talk or let's have this conversation real quick. Is this for you a cost cutting scenario or what? Are you basically just trying to make business more efficient? Because we usually think in FTE equivalent. So you could basically rationalize this cost center internally.
Speaker 3: It's not necessarily people cutting, it's trying to, you know, use people in a more effective way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: But the reality at the moment is that we're in that because we, we keep growing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: It's difficult to keep up with the level of staff and I'm reluctant to take more people on knowing that I can automate some of these painful processes and have better insight and, and workflows and you know, all the good stuff that we, we know can be done. So we're sort of in this situation at the moment where everyone's running around like crazy people trying to get things done.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: And we do. I could easily employ another five people here to, for, for the workload that we've got. So in my mind if we could make ourselves more efficient then potentially and also it makes people's roles more enjoyable. 100 at the moment, you know, you're just answering emails and you're going on getting a certificate and putting it on there. We can make it more proactive so we could be proactively selling to our customers and we can, you know, we've got loads of ideas about things we want to do, we just never get the time to do them.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. That's true. I understand. I like the perspective. Okay, understood. So we have four more minutes just for the, for the sake of the call. So you've also seen what we've actually, what we actually do. I want to walk you through our platform. So what you're seeing here is our home screen. You're greeted with the natural language interface. So you as a non techie could potentially also build agents as you're doing in N8N right now. The hard transparent answer is it's still incredible, hard, incredibly hard to build agents that actually work. I don't know how Your experience with N8N was, but most of the people, people we talk to, they get frustrated because they basically doesn't work. You need to have a certain level of understanding how these systems work, which we, which we have. So you could build an agent potentially. But I'll skip this, the building flow for a second because I have a demo agent here on the left hand side. This is the email triage agent. As you see, this agent is working on tasks just like you and I. You see a couple of them, for example, they are failed. Here we need to train our agent. Here our agent wants some more input. Or here we have an agent that actually has this consent required button. This is basically our human and loop feature. And here he wants me to look over it and accept it. And the second I accept it, he then further processes this task. And if we now look into one of the tasks that are maybe completed, let's make this a bit bigger here to give you. So you see this is now quite an old email. This was six months ago, but here I got an inquiry via an email. In this case it was an email to the Deere sales team where Samuel Lee sent something. I think he wants information on pricing, timelines and consulting services apparently. And you see all of the meta information. So you see it was an email delivered to our service inbox by my colleague Mustaba. Here you see the email in plain text. So this is the whole input trigger. And then the agent goes ahead and starts working on this flow that we taught him. So and the first step he needs to detect the relevance of this email. What we do in the triage flows is that we usually these inboxes get a lot of spam. So we like to filter out all of the relevant stuff. So spam gets filtered out. And then we're going to categorize this email. After categorization we then determine if this needs to be forwarded to somebody. So maybe somebody internally needs to work on it or if we can further process it. What you're seeing here is based on a flow. This is for example an example flow that we built with our agent. It's essentially a knowledge graph. It's if this, then that. So if the email is relevant then you further proceed. If not, this is an exit condition and we don't touch this email. We could also play around with an archive the email or mark spam for example and then the agent is going to follow what we taught him, ultimately sending an email back. And what we do here is I think this is really important to understand the concept real quick. We either have integration based tools, as you see sending an email, replying to an email, forwarding something, the typical API actions, or we do have LLM or prompt based tools. And after the prompt based tool or behind the prompt based tool, there's always a best practice prompt which is pre generated by our platform and now our AI agent engineer based on your feedback or the autotuner feature that we would have come in and basically iterate this prompt based on what you tell us or based on the feedback you give to the platform and then ultimately these prompts get better behind. We're playing around. This is now demo space. This is where you also see deepseek in here. It's not live, we're playing around with it. Most of the party happens based on OpenAI models and anthropic models because these are currently just the best with just the front runner being OpenAI. It's just the best for all of these flows for us. We're also an official IBM partner, so we also have the IBM models in here. Transparent answer is the model is not the best. So most of it happens on Anthropic for coding and GPT for text based interactions. And then as you see we do have HubSpot in here, so you could basically just add the single sign on for HubSpot. Odoo should actually also be in here. Yes, you can also play around with Odoo. And then I saw while you were sharing your screen, we also have Monday.com I think you already also use this one.
Speaker 3: Yeah, we're phasing that out, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Quentin Silvestro: And then for your portal for example, we would create a custom integration. So you would need to give us an API key and then based on the API key we can start enabling the action points which would then query this customer or what is download PDF, these kind of actions. And then we could map the flow out around your. Around your needs. Maybe I'll Stop there for a second. So you've seen it at least?
Speaker 3: Yeah, no, it's fantastic. You know, this is a great conversation. I think. Just one question on the. On the Open AI. So we have a paid subscription.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: I'm assuming that we can use that as part of the, you know, if we had to provide. Or is it your OpenAI that gets used? How does that work?
Quentin Silvestro: So we use the OpenAI business API, ensuring that all of the data is within Europe and won't be used for training.
Speaker 1: So.
Quentin Silvestro: So I would strongly advise to not play around with your own APIs. It's. In the end, the usage cost could be a bit lower. We could look into this. If you really insist on it, at least for the beginning of the project. I would say let's not do this because it's not worth the effort. If after three months you say, oh, the usage costs are getting higher and higher and I ultimately want to pay via my own API key. We can, we can do this, but then you need to host the whole platform in your instance and we need to deploy this in your cloud, which then also gives us three months more. So, yes, potentially. But these are more enterprise things that we do with bigger clients where it's worth the effort in our collaboration. I'll be very transparent and honest. I think it's not worth it.
Speaker 3: Okay. But in terms of us being able to provide an answer for things like gdpr and if it's customer data, it's not used to train or exposed in any way.
Quentin Silvestro: No, we are fully socked to ISO, HIPAA and GDPR compliant. So all of the certifications are in place. Plus we run our models in our cloud instance with the business APIs, which ensures that no data leaves our instance for training. And all of our servers are in the European Union hosted in Frankfurt, so fullest or highest security standards. One of our biggest clients are big German banks on the BAFIN regulation, so we're pretty secure.
Speaker 1: Brilliant.
Speaker 3: Okay. No, it's great. So, yeah, if you follow up with an NDA and rough idea on costs and.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 3: But yeah, be interested to take this forward.
Quentin Silvestro: That sounds great. On cost, very transparent, straightforward. I would say. I would give you a rough indication of on. As you have multiple flows. I think it makes sense to book one of our engineers for a couple of months and then we could reassess how far we've come and if we still need this. And then you can. You're in the driver's seat on this cost center. So, yes, I will send you an email with detailed indication on cost plus advice how I would structure such project. And I will also send you mutual NDA and then rest can go from there.
Speaker 3: Lovely to meet you. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Quentin Silvestro: Thanks for time and interest. See you soon.
Speaker 3: Take care.
Speaker 1: Bye. Bye.
