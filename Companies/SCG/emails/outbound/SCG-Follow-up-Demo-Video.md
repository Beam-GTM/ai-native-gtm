## EMAIL CONTENT

Hi SCG team,

Thank you for the thorough demo session yesterday. Rather than send you more generic AI capabilities presentations, I want to directly address the three main concerns we heard from your team.

### **"Not Actually Processing"**

You mentioned feeling that our demo wasn't actually processing documents - you're absolutely right to call this out. Generic demos with mock data don't show real capability.

**Our approach**: We've created a custom SCG demo space that shows actual Thai contractor document processing. On Slide 7 of the attached presentation, you'll find a demo video that processes a real Thai construction completion certificate - not simulated data.

**What you'll see**: Real OCR extraction of Thai text, translation to English, and the complete contractor payment verification workflow using actual document data.

### **Process Mismatch**

You identified a critical disconnect between what we demonstrated (reconciliation and booking) and what you actually need (contractor payment verification in construction). This is exactly the kind of process alignment issue that kills implementations.

**Our approach**: The custom demo space is built specifically around SCG's contractor payment verification process:
- Thai construction completion certificates
- Contractor payment processing workflow
- Construction industry terminology and standards
- SCG-specific approval and quality validation processes

**Bottom line**: We've aligned the demo with your actual workflow, not generic document processing.

### **AI Accuracy Concerns**

Your concerns about AI accuracy in financial processes are completely valid. Construction payments require high accuracy and audit trails.

**Our approach**: The demo includes:
- Confidence scores for all extractions
- Manual review triggers for low-confidence results
- Complete audit trails for all processing steps
- Quality validation against Thai Industrial Standards

**Result**: Transparent accuracy metrics and human oversight where needed.

### **Custom Demo Space Details**

The demo space we built specifically for SCG includes:

**Real Thai Document Processing**:
- Sample construction completion certificate from Thai contractor
- Live OCR extraction and translation
- Construction terminology mapping
- Thai Industrial Standards compliance checking

**SCG-Specific Workflow**:
- Contractor payment verification process
- Project manager approval routing
- Quality standards validation
- Payment processing and audit trail generation

**Technical Validation**:
- Processing accuracy metrics
- Confidence score reporting
- Error handling and escalation paths
- Integration with SCG systems

### **Next Steps**

I know you're evaluating solutions for contractor payment verification. What I can promise is that we've heard your specific concerns about real processing, process alignment, and AI accuracy - and we're addressing them directly with this custom demo space.

If you need to see more technical details about the Thai document processing capabilities or have questions about the demo workflow, I'm available for follow-up calls this week.

Best regards,
[Your name]
