Quentin Silvestro: Hello.
Ignacio Joaristi: Hello.
Speaker 3: Hello.
Ignacio Joaristi: Oh, I can. There you are.
Speaker 3: Hi. Morning. How are you doing?
Quentin Silvestro: Great, thank you. Good. You appeared like a ghost there.
Ignacio Joaristi: It was nothing and then it just popped up.
Speaker 3: Yeah, I just want to like cause it right sometime. I mean, I just accidentally mentally and I just want to be sure that I checked before. Yeah.
Ignacio Joaristi: I believe we haven't met Suti before, so this is nice.
Speaker 3: Yeah. Actually there will be more. Two more people joining in the call. Let me check with the team just a bit.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah. There we go. So Chatiwat is here.
Speaker 3: Okay. Yeah.
Ignacio Joaristi: Super. Yeah. Today we also have Quentin in this call that I'm really happy that you that you're gonna be meeting.
Speaker 3: Nice to meet you.
Quentin Silvestro: Hey there. Nice to meet you guys.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah. I'll give you, Quentin a moment to introduce yourself in a minute. But yeah, maybe if you want before that you can introduce Suthi and Kanita to us so they can introduce themselves and just take it from there.
Speaker 3: Sure. Maybe. Quentin, do you want to go first?
Quentin Silvestro: I can go first. Yeah. Okay. Hi, my name is Quentin. Nice to meet all of you. I am one of the first commercial employees here at Beam. Started off the journey actually in Agnesio. You told me the team is from the venture capitalist side, correct? Of the business?
Ignacio Joaristi: Yes, yes, they are.
Quentin Silvestro: I actually started off as one of Beam's investors because I was spending two and a half years in early stage venture capital. Then we invested in Beam and then I thought, okay, now we did vc. Why don't we now just hop onto the operational side of things? And that's how I joined. So here since the early beginning, building up our go to market motion, currently expanding a lot in North America, which I'm busy with. But on the other hand, side spending a lot with our say, strategic customers. And I always say my journey or basically my role within this company is building these agentic journeys from your company, now fully run by humans, where people work under people. And how can we start transforming this into implementing AI into these key functions? Yes, that's me. Before I take it over to show you guys the platform and how it works, I would say let's throw the ball back and introduce the rest of the group.
Speaker 3: Sure. Because Keaton, you didn't join the call last time when I had a call with Inacio. Right. So basically me and Chatiwat, we are from the corporate venture capital teams. So we not only looking for the investment, but actually more on the commercial partnership as well. I believe that Inacio already with you about that and the rest of the team, for example, Suti here in the core Kanita and also Napat. They are from the corporate innovation team which work closely with the business unit team. So basically I think they are the one who will help us to in terms of the conversation with the business unit team. So I will let them make some introductions a bit. Maybe Suti, you and you want to go first?
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 4: Yeah. Hello, my name is smti. Yeah, I'm from corporate innovation office. Yeah, the the same team with five but actually now I'm focused on AI transformation project.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 4: And for now we focus on the accounting area. Yeah. And also we bring Kanita in this call. Yeah, she is a guy in accounting team.
Quentin Silvestro: Yep.
Speaker 4: Probably this call. I think you can demo some solution of your your product first and then if we are interested you can deep dive further.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 3: And maybe. Yeah, yeah.
Ignacio Joaristi: And from the same team and role with the city.
Quentin Silvestro: So but now I looking for the different angle of. You said the platform like AI native platform. Bring the ChatGPT or something like the platform like this to our SAT for.
Ignacio Joaristi: Integrate with outweigh it guideline or our policy.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, yeah. Cool, thank you. What's this everybody? No, we have one more. Hi.
Speaker 3: I'm from the corporate accounting office of SAT and I'm looking for the automation caused agent AI cost to integrate into the procurement or the payment platform integration, something like that.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool, thank you. Okay, I think now we did a round robin. That's great. I will take it over and introduce you guys into what we're doing in finance and accounting. Essentially our whole beam journey always we did stuff within the whole order to cash flow without knowing it at first. And now we are having this full cycle moment where we see okay, we can basically start automating a lot of these frictions or friction processes that finance and accounting teams are doing from hey, I have an order, I ultimately need to extract order details, put it somewhere. Then I need to validate the order, do the order confirmations. Then we come into a bit of a procure to pay flow where I need to buy stuff, I need to do the two and three way matching with the pos and then ultimately the second I have bought something I have ideally have a goods that I can sell. So the second that we transfer this into an actual invoice, we're then in the invoice to cash accounts receivables flow where we do a lot of invoice creation, reconciliation, payment reminders, donning and ultimately collections. Collections is actually one of our strongest, I would say automation departments that we have internally as One of our largest clients is one of the top five debt collectors in Germany. What we do for them is essentially automating the complete debtors journey. Because I can be insolvent, but I can also do installment plans. It varies in what kind of path I fall and for them we basically started automating all of these different scenarios and now we're going upstream again into this value chain of okay, before collections we have dunning and before dunning we have reminders, reconciliation and then ultimately an invoice creation. And this journey is what I'm going to take you guys today through. I'll zoom in a bit on accounts receivables because this is the team which we are the strongest in and we have the best demos and then I'll give you a rough overview of how we think about agents, how we're building them in our platform and how this could look like for you. Feel free to jump in if you have questions and if you want to deep dive on any of the specific parts and I can just stop and share these things, I will now take over sharing real quick. You will see yourself for a second and then you see my platform. Could you confirm this Rukh quick?
Speaker 3: Yep.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. That is great. Okay, so you are greeted with our home screen. Here you have a natural language chat interface out of which you can start creating agents. This is fully natural language based which means if you want to dump an SOP or you want to dump a process description, we're going into a guided flow where we ask you a bunch of details and with this information we're going to help you start building your first agent. For the sake of time, I'm going to skip the whole agent setup flow. We have a nice little video that we're going to to provide you with after the call and adequate can rewatch how we set up agents. I think for the, for the demo, the most valuable is we start talking about the actual agents that you see on the left hand side. Now within accounts receivables we are back to that flow and loop that I was describing you earlier. We have an invoice creation and ultimately we have debt that we want to have paid if our clients didn't pay us. So if we jump into one of these agents, let's say invoice creation, all of these agents work on tasks. This is just like a human being. Think of me or our agent as an intern that gets hired into your accounting accounting team and you're going to give me a certain job which is essentially an sop. That you have internally do this and that. If this, then that and I get triggered. Which can be, for example, a new sales order that is signed. And now I need to start creating an invoice. So the sales order signage is the trigger. So what happens is the agent gets triggered with, in this case, sales order data that you see here. It's order id, order date, customer number, what they bought, all of the necessary information that I need to know in order to create an invoice and then I will stop going through my flow. So first of all, hey, I need to verify, is this really a good sales order? Is this verified? If this is verified, I need to verify the customer. What kind of tax or currency or VAT IDs do I need to do? I need to apply. And if I have all of the tax calculations, I can go ahead and generate the invoice. What you're seeing here is a tool in SAP in Europe. A lot of our clients use SAP for this demo. The SAP tool is mocked. Just so you know, I can now not show you the actual SAP screen, but we can show you a demo in a second where we have databases, where you can also see that the agents push data. And then ultimately, because we work with a lot of enterprise teams and this is something that you can fully design, what most of our customers want, they have a little notification and an invoice channel in teams or in Slack or whatsoever, or where the actual human being can see what our little intern is doing and also correct, for example. So coming back to what I was saying, AI agents are basically just like human, like workers with Beam, think of them as an intern that get triggered with an inquiry. They think about it and then they execute on it based on your sop. Now if I go into this flow again, you see, this is essentially the exact same thing that I was showing you. Here comes the sales order verification. I validate, I have the customer verification, I have to tax and ultimately I generate the invoice behind this. There's always a tool. Now with Beam, there are two types of tools. I think for this I might jump into, for example, a reconciliation agent, because this looks a bit more complex and actually has a couple of more paths. What this agent is doing, it is either handling with an API or an integration based tool. I need to do something in SAP, in QuickBooks, in Gmail, in Outlook, or I need to handle something with an LLM based prompt. And what we do here is, for example, the payment data extraction. Behind this there's a best practice prompt which is in this case run on GPT 4.0 where you see best practice prompting and we tell the agent exactly what he needs to do. This prompt is auto generated by the platform. When you start creating an agent, you can review that in the video. And now I as an expert can go in here and start playing around with the parameter context, the variables and basically tell the agent exactly what it needs to do as for example how it should reason or how it should do certain things. So what we do here is we combine the traditional world of standard if this, then that statements with the power of AI to bring in the LLM in the right moment when they need to reason, analyze or do something. We're basically mimicking human behavior. I'm copy pasting some information from one two into the another. In between I think about it and then I abstract what I need to do with it. Now you saw a couple of integrations and tools. So this is now an invoice reconciliation agent. Not everything is completed, of course. For example, in this case the agent found a discrepancy. So he sees the actual invoice or the payment that the client provided us with is not the exact amount for example, or a different name or invoice number than the invoice that we actually provided him with. So now the agent going to give me this output and this is now a JSON format. We can make this also into nice text and wants me to review it and to accept it. If I accept it, the agent then goes ahead, queues the task again, thinks about it and then this will pop up as completed in a second. We also have things where the agent needs additional input. So it's now going to ask you for example, in this case he wasn't really sure where to take to get the transaction from in zap. Where do I need to, what kind of table do I need to retrieve the data? So I can now either tell him here in the chat interface or I go back to the prompt and edit it in here and tell him where to look. Or in the integration, which we have a long list of integrations out of the box, out of our integrations that we have pre built already. So you can just start connecting them via auth. If you for example use ServiceNow, you can start enabling these endpoints and then everything that we don't have, as for example custom integration that you have pre built in house internally already, we can go ahead and implement the actions via an API key or just general authentication methods. Now last but not least, the configuration of an agent Agents always are set up with a memory so you can dump additional information in here. SOPs, context, information compliance, regulation, you can see the integrations that the agent is using or you see the trigger. In this case, I am triggering everything via webhook because it's just the easiest for me. But we can obviously also go ahead and say, hey, new invoice and folder, new email received, or a very, very standard thing, every Monday morning, 9am, go here and then do this. Or we just do hard API calls. And then ultimately what you're going to have is a nice little analytics dashboard where you see the actual runtime of the agent, what it's done, how the evaluation score is. Right now we haven't trained our agent good enough yet, so it needs a little ramp up time. Just like a human being that you hire, we need to train him and we're going to iterate on human feedback. And that's also where the magic sauce come in. Because via feedback we can actually push this back to our agent. Let's say he did something wrong here, I can give him feedback and we're going to use this actual feedback from the human being to iterate our prompts via our auto tuner mechanism, which is an automatic prompt optimization, let me put it that way. But maybe we stop here for a second and jump into either questions that you might have, how we would actually implement this in your team. How we reduce, for example, the training time for new employees and shortening this onboarding slash ramp up time and how we actually work with clients. So over to you if there are questions. If not, I think I did. I did a great job, Ignacio.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah, I think so too.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. I will stop sharing for a second because I can't see you if you don't have questions. Then I can also share how next steps would look like. No questions.
Speaker 5: One second. So Bob might have me.
Speaker 4: I have no question now.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay. Should we go into next steps how we usually work with clients?
Speaker 5: Yeah, I think so.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. So after this, now consider this a little get to know in which we say, okay, we validate each other that either our platform and we as a vendor can be a successful partner. We could now take this into multiple channels. Either we work in a direct client vendor relationship in which we say, okay, let's go into your accounting department, let's map out the flows where you see most of the friction and most of the delays, or also even the biggest cost center right now and start implementing the first agent. We can do this either via doing a small POC In a sandbox environment where you have this additional validation hurdle, or we can also go ahead and start implementing an agent directly. It is always either a done for you or done with you approach. So depending on the tech capabilities that you have internally, you can either start playing around with the platform yourself with minimal support from our end, or you can basically hire us to do it for you. Then it's a time and material component in all of the contracts where you have one forward deployed engineer that we supply you with. It's going to sit with you, it's going to help you and it's going to build the agent for you. And together and within this we are going to do the knowledge transfer. So these are basically the dimensions of collaboration that we can take from here. On the other hand side, as you are now mainly in Asia and we are not 100% present there yet, we can also look into the partnerships path where we can start validating this each other with a small collaboration first. And then we could go into your client basis, your collaborations and your connections that you have in order to go into a bit of a co selling opportunity. These are the paths that we see. In the end you need to tell us where you see most value.
Speaker 3: Sure, I think that's our case as for the next step, but I think for the product we still want to see more. I think you mentioned in the beginning, for example debt collectors.
Quentin Silvestro: Right.
Speaker 3: And also some source of procurement. If you can share us how it works so that we can understand more in the big pictures on the platform.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, could you describe a bit deeper in detail with the actual requirements you want to see? So I know what I need to show pimi.
Speaker 3: You have some examples.
Speaker 5: I, I think in general like ARAP or like invoice processing, if that is. Is that a good start?
Quentin Silvestro: I mean that's a very good start. If you talk about processing, do you talk about the reconciliation part or the booking part?
Speaker 5: I'm sorry, can you repeat again, if.
Quentin Silvestro: You talk about invoice processing, for me this is a big bit of a higher level use case. Within invoice processing we usually see the reconciliation which is looking at the transactions in the bank statement and reconciling if the client paid us the full amount or we're looking into the actual booking. So let's say we reconciled the invoice already. Now we need to book it in our book in our systems, probably the reconciliation. Okay, so the reconciliation flow is the one that I just showed you. I can go into much more detail if you want. So this is again, we are back in our AR flow. So you see, the agent worked on some reconciliation tasks and in here we do have a couple of steps. So what we do in the first step, again the SAP connection is mocked. Just so you know. So we don't interact with SAP in this demo space. We do for our clients. The thing with SAP is their API is a big flower pot of flowers and we always need to pick the right ones. And SAP contracts are actually quite heavy. So right now the first step is usually what we need to do. We need to receive the payment data out of the transaction history. So we are going to look either on a daily, weekly, monthly basis and on your bank statements and what money has come in, what kind of receivables did we have. Then we're going to extract all of the payment data out of these transactions and we're going to then fetch all of the outstanding invoices that we have. And then ultimately the magic happens in this step where we do an invoice transaction matching or monitoring. Behind this there is a tool, and this tool is essentially a prompt. And the prompt does exactly what the human being would do. It would look at the transactions and it would look at all of the outstanding invoices and would start matching them against each other based on metadata, which can be the customer id, it can be transaction amount, it can be some kind of detail that we get in order to match them, because sometimes clients also forget. And then we go ahead and we start matching the invoices. If we were able to determine a match, the agent is going to take these two documents, match them against each other and then find discrepancies. Or it is an exact match which will then determine the next step of the flow. So let's say you have an invoice and a transaction matching. That could obviously be something where we don't have the actual match. So what we could do is either notify somebody via Microsoft Teams or by an email or whatsoever. This is fully dependent on what you could, what do you want to do? We could also send an email via Outlook and it would go ahead Match tool and send an email to you. Obviously we need to configure this a bit more, but in the end this is what the agent is going to do. And then while this tool is fetching, we could log into the partial matching flow. So it could also be on the other hand side that we have, for example, something where the transaction amount is correct, the customer ID is correct, but they applied the wrong VAT or they Used a discount or something like this, which is then a partial match. For this we could do the matching and have a manual review, but we could also just go ahead and start configuring the flow as you would want it. You see in this case, by the way, he fetched now the sent an email tool behind this there's a Gmail and Outlook integration which you could now connect and if you connect via all three would be able to send emails. And we're going to specify here what kind of emails the agent should send. And then we obviously have the happy flow, which is the exact match processing in which we say, okay, could be either validate the successful reconciliation, we're going to update the status, book it, and then ultimately update the customer balance, for example. And this very important, this is a flow that we've demoed and this is something that we do with our clients, but it must not necessarily be your flow. What we could also do is if we now go ahead and create a new agent in this space, for example, create a new invoice. Let me go this path, sorry, create a new invoice processing agent. The agent will go ahead and ask me a bunch of questions and then I can create a new agent which you will then see popping up on the left hand side. I bypass the context gathering real quick because I want you to show you just the empty shell. If you now understand what I want it understands. Okay. I want to create an invoice processing agent. So it's going to come up with this empty shell of an agent which you see here. If I now create this agent, you see it popping up here on the left hand side. And I could now make this the SCG invoice processing agent. I could give it your logo and now this is customizable to you and we could start mapping out the flow how a flow would look like with you with branches, conditions and whatever you want. It depends. So this is also part of our value that we bring with the collaboration. One of our AI agent engineers is if you wanted to going to sit with you, map out all of the processes and is going to translate this into an actual agent. Does this make sense? Yeah.
Speaker 5: I can visualize how it works. But like what about. Can you show me how it perform in action?
Quentin Silvestro: Sure. Ignacio, you had the airtables where the agent was pushing data, correct?
Ignacio Joaristi: The airtables, yeah. Let me try and get that up. One second. Good. Then let me show an example for a demo we did with one second here. Okay, so let me share my screen. This is some mock data that we created to do a demo. What you can see here is that you can have an invoice database directly here, where after an agent goes ahead and reconciles and finds the date, invoice then finds the relevant supplier, finds the payment terms, finds the invoice date. So this is all that the agent will be interacting with, basically. And. One second, let me go ahead and share what this agent looks like. Okay, wait a sec. Window.
Quentin Silvestro: There we go.
Ignacio Joaristi: Okay, so this is an example. This is an input reconciliation, another demo aid that we did a while back. As you can see by the dates here, you have some specific tasks. Let me just make this one bigger. You can see that the agent is triggered by a specific message from Bob Supplier basically saying that it wants to check the status of a specific invoice. So if we look at an example of a mock invoice, you will have, for example here, the specific person, they're sending it to, the amount. This is just a basic mocked invoice that we created internally at Beam. And then we'll go ahead and detect that email relevance. And then you can see here that the email is relevant because it's talking about a specific invoice. It's missing people. It's important for the financial transactions. It'll go ahead and extract all the relevant information. So in this case, it extracted euros as the currency, the due date, the amount due, the invoice date, the supplier name, invoice number and the general attached file. This invoice status is then checked directly on airtable. If we then go into our mock space here, over here at Airtable, you will see the status of the specific invoice. If we go back here, we see that this is for invoice 2001. So if we go here and find invoice 2001, you can see that the status has been paid at a specific booking date and payment date. And this is in general how an agent usually interacts with the database. At this point, we're just using airtable as a simple way to mimic what could be your own CRM or tool where you keep, or erp, where you keep all of your payment information, all of your supplier information, and how you want to deal with these invoices. But that's an example of how it works. So after extracting the payment and transaction history as well, it'll check that the invoice is booking paid, as you saw before, it was already paid. And they will go ahead and draft a reply to the person saying that the invoice has been paid as an example. But yeah, this is usually how the agent works with specific tools. It'll go ahead and extract information from invoices and interact with the database to sort of go about the entire flow.
Quentin Silvestro: To see how.
Ignacio Joaristi: The status of an invoice is.
Speaker 5: Great, thank you so much. I see a lot clearer picture.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah.
Speaker 5: Let me ask our team if there's any question or anything you guys want to see in more detail.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah, I would say, like, allow us, like the next hour, just allow me to send you a short video of a more detailed reconciliation flow with the active summary, with active invoices, with the database, everything. So you'll see it in more clarity, exactly how it works with the flow, how an active task looks like, and we'll make sure to get that to you.
Quentin Silvestro: Good.
Speaker 5: Maybe one question from me, like, do you have any features or templates for evaluation, like between flows or between different ways you prompt an agent?
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So evaluation is actually one of our ethics core usps against our competitors, because what we focus on is building very deterministic and accurate agents at scale. So some of our clients, for example, run tens of thousands of tasks a week. And we want to ensure that these agents always are above at least 95, 97% accuracy to have this at an enterprise level. So what we do for that is we have two mechanisms. Mechanism one is our own evaluation framework that we have internally. This comes during the setup phase. So building an agent and deploying it and setting it up is roughly something that needs time, from six to eight months, sometimes even 12 weeks. This is something that you need to consider if you want to set up an agent. If you want to have it working on an enterprise grade, you need to calculate some time in order to make it work. What we do here is we're going to mimic actually what the human being is doing. Let's say we take the last hundred transactions and the last hundred invoices, and we're going to map the best case human output against it. So what would have been the best human example or best human output that we could have achieved? And we determined this as a golden data set. And this golden data set is everything that we're going to refer to during our training sessions. Because ideally, this golden data set has a bright variety of edge cases. It has a couple of happy flows, but it also has edge case one, edge case two, edge case three. And by doing this and training the agent on this bright variety of edge cases and labeling it as the golden data set, we are able to give it these accuracy measures. And the accuracy measures is exactly what we're going to train them. The agent on or measure usually we deploy after a POC, for example, with 80% accuracy and supervised autonomy, where the human being always looks over what the agent is doing and nothing goes out without human approval. Within this human in the loop phase, we're going to collect all of this feedback. And so for example, I reconciled an invoice wrong. You are going to tell me, hey Quentin, this was wrong because Coca Cola was not the Chinese entity, but it was the Singaporean. So simple mistake that I can make as an intern. I'm going to use this feedback and I'm going to translate it in my prompt. And via this we have the second stage or the second pillar which I'm now going to describe, which we call our auto tuner feature, which is basically an automatic way to prompt engineer our agents based on human feedback. And again we mimic what's happening in the human brain, which is learning. You're going to tell me this was wrong, I'm going to understand it, I'm going to do it different the next time. This is what we call agent learning slash our auto tuner. So coming back to your question, yes, we do have templates for evaluations which are very sophisticated in setup and automated in supervised autonomy. Got it? Yeah.
Speaker 5: Thank you so much.
Quentin Silvestro: Of course.
Speaker 4: Give me your. Let me see my hub. Oh, okay. Yeah, I have some questions. I'm not sure it's similar process with invoice processing that you show or not. It's like as of now we try to reduce the manual effort to verification the payment that our employee reimburse. Like I can give you some figure as of now just only 20%. We can do the auto verification process, but the rest, yeah, the rest of document. We need many, many staff to verify that document. And one of the a big problem of us is we cannot track like generate the information from the document. Like the OCR problem in Thai. Yeah, it's not 100% exactly.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, we've. We've had this similar issue before. One of our clients is actually a large MVNO which is for mobile virtual network operator. They operate in Telco and what they do is they have a lot of subsidiaries in Thailand and what they, what happens there is they need to send its monthly end reportings on the data usage. It's a different use case but it's the same problem. And what the Thai suppliers are doing, they're sending them PDF documents in Thai language obviously. So then they had the Issue that they need people who are able to read and speak Thai in order to interpret these documents and then reconcile. And what we've did with them is we actually have a document extraction flow live which we could probably demo as well. In that video we can do something in Thai. We've done it before where the agent extracts document data in Thai, understands it, translates it to English and then further processes. We can obviously also do everything in Thai, but ideally we process to English at one point because LLMs like OpenAI Anthropic, they're all trained on English language so they, they are more accurate if we transfer them into English. Now coming back to the point that you were saying, yes, we can do it and yes, our agents speak 40 languages including Thai.
Speaker 4: So you mean we need the platform need to process from Thai to English first before.
Quentin Silvestro: Well, we have our own inbuilt ocr. So what we're going to do is we're going to extract the complete document data in Thai and then we're going to have a translation step where the agent understands it, reasons and then translates it into English. We've seen great results with this. We can obviously look into the accuracy and accuracy improves. But we would strongly recommend doing the translation step because LLMs just work better in English. Okay. We can obviously translate it back to Thai if you want into your systems. Okay, yeah.
Speaker 4: And another question is like the accuracy of the verification flow. I mean if we use the manual verification, it means our staff, they need to check in the document one by one. I'm not sure the accuracy. If we use like the agentic flow that you chose, it can compare with the manual effort.
Quentin Silvestro: Could you describe exactly what you mean? Do you mean in terms of that the AI won't get as accurate as the human being or that we won't be able to supply the human being with an interface to look at and compare AI versus human.
Speaker 4: The first one. I mean for example, if the first document, if we have the staff, the staff need to see the detail in the document and compare with the things that employees input in our systems. Yeah, I mean if it's not correct, our accounting staff will hold that document and send it back to our staff. Yeah, I'm not sure AI can replace these process or it still need to the staff to, to reject it.
Quentin Silvestro: Again, I think document verification and checks and validations are one of the best use cases you can give AI. And right now I would say I'm pretty sure that we can actually hit human accuracy. The best thing we can do is we can show you if you want. If you can provide us with one of these documents that you're talking about, we can actually show you and the questions that the human being would need to look at, like what kind of boxes? And we can validate this together. But this is also our job and this is also our offering. We help you build agentic systems for very complex flows and make them work on high accuracy. So if you doubt the accuracy, either we prove you that it works or we can also build something in a POC where it is, where you validate this internally. This is essentially what the first collaboration would look like.
Speaker 4: Yeah, I got it.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, sorry.
Speaker 4: One of our obstacle is like accounting stuff. They are not 100% confident on the result from the AI verification.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, this is a change management thing internally we see it with a lot of clients that people don't trust the AI and there are a lot of safety measures and safeguards before they actually see, ah, wait, it is even better than the human being sometimes. But this is a process that usually naturally comes in a collaboration. Coming back to one thing that you said in the beginning, you said you can only straight through process 20% of your invoices right now, which gives US room for 80%. So let's say if the AI is not 100% accurate, we will still be able to increase the 20% by at least another 20. And I think I'm very, very confident that we can grow into 60, 70, 80% processing rate. This is what I think. But even at least if we do additional 20, we doubled your efficiency.
Speaker 4: Yeah, for, for just 20 that we can do. The auto verification is like a basic rule base, for example, like if the money that we imbursed is less than X. But yeah, we can pass through this process. Yeah, but some kind of really complex reimbursement. We need to our staff to see each document.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, yeah, I see. I mean in the end with these very complex flows and where you, I mean it is not replacing the human being completely. We as beam think we were going to replace certain percentages of a job profile and this could for example be processing low level refunds or low level reimbursements. And I don't think if it's very complex that we're going to do 100% and complete the human and replace the human completely. But I'm very certain that we can start drilling into this replacement or automation bucket more than 20% because what you've just said, it's rule based. This is what RPA can do like Power Automate or your iPad or whatsoever. And what we do is basically we do apa, which is agentic process automation. And with APA we're able to bring in the power of AI into specific nodes in your RPA flow in order to enhance the automation grade. So we are going to just further drill down into your bucket of further automatable cases with AI.
Speaker 4: Got it.
Ignacio Joaristi: That sounds like, just. If I may add, that sounds like a fantastic use case to. If you were interested to. At the recent video, etc. It sounds like a great use case to kick things off since. Yeah, verification is. I mean, a great sort of portion and reconciliation. But yeah, I think we can discuss about that after we have to send over a video and you can get back to us and yeah, from there.
Quentin Silvestro: If you are still not. If you're still unconvinced and you don't trust the AI. If you want, you can also send us an example of a Thai document and tell us what kind of things we need to extract and validate and we'll show you.
Ignacio Joaristi: Yeah, we can sign that NDA if needed. You can send us a sample data set. We'll just do that free of charge. Show you the real power of beam and take it from there.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Okay.
Ignacio Joaristi: So let us know what you would you'd like to prefer.
Speaker 4: Probably after seeing the video demo from your side. I will discuss with the accounting team first.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 4: And if they like to try or to test with some document.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Speaker 4: I will contact you again.
Ignacio Joaristi: Okay, fantastic. Then we have some quick homework to get back to you with and I don't know if there's anything else you'd like to go over or any other questions.
Speaker 3: No, for me, I'm good.
Ignacio Joaristi: Okay. Yeah, perfect.
Speaker 3: For me.
Ignacio Joaristi: Then you should be getting the video later today and we look forward to your response.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. All right. Okay.
Ignacio Joaristi: Fantastic day. Thank you.
Speaker 3: Have a nice day. Bye. Bye.
Quentin Silvestro: Bye. Bye.
Speaker 3: Thank you.
