# SCG Contractor Payment Verification Agent - Implementation Guide
**Generated**: 2025-09-19T11:20:00Z  
**Framework**: Demo Agent Automation  
**Status**: Ready for Deployment

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Overview

### What We've Built
A comprehensive **Construction Contractor Payment Verification Agent** specifically designed for SCG's actual use case:

- **Real Process**: Contractor completion certificate verification (not customer invoice reconciliation)
- **Thai Language Support**: OCR and translation for Thai construction documents
- **Construction Domain**: Specialized for construction materials and project workflows
- **SCG Integration**: Designed for SCG's project management and payment systems

### Key Correction from Original Demo
- **Original Demo**: Customer invoice reconciliation (wrong process)
- **Correct Solution**: Contractor payment verification (right process)
- **Direction**: Outbound payments to contractors (not inbound from customers)
- **Documents**: Thai construction completion certificates (not customer invoices)
