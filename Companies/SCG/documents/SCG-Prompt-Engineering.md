## ðŸ“‹ Core Processing Prompts

### 1. Thai OCR Processing & Translation Prompt

```
TASK: Extract and translate Thai construction completion certificate to English

INPUT: Thai construction document (PDF/image) + supporting materials

VALIDATION STEPS:
1. IF document format is PDF or image â†’ PROCEED to OCR processing
2. IF document format is unsupported â†’ RETURN error "Unsupported format. Please submit PDF or image file."
3. IF document is empty or corrupted â†’ RETURN error "Document appears corrupted. Please resubmit."

OCR PROCESSING:
1. EXTRACT all visible Thai text from document
2. IDENTIFY document type (completion certificate, material receipt, inspection report)
3. STRUCTURE extracted text into logical sections

OUTPUT VARIABLES TO EXTRACT:
- contractor_name: "English contractor company name"
- project_id: "SCG project identifier"
- work_type: "Type of construction work performed"
- completion_date: "Work completion date"
- material_cost: "Total material costs in THB"
- labor_cost: "Total labor costs in THB"
- other_costs: "Other service costs in THB"
- total_amount: "Total project amount in THB"
- vat_amount: "VAT amount in THB"
- final_amount: "Final amount after VAT in THB"
- quality_status: "Quality compliance status"
- inspection_date: "Quality inspection date"
- bank_account: "Contractor bank account number"
- bank_name: "Contractor bank name"
- work_description: "Detailed work description in English"
- material_list: "List of materials used in English"
- quality_certificates: "Quality certificate status"
- inspector_name: "Quality inspector name"
- inspector_license: "Inspector license number"

IF text extraction fails or accuracy < 80% â†’ ESCALATE to manual OCR review
