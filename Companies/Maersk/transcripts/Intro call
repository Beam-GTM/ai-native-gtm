Quentin Silvestro: It. Hey, Craig, how's it going?
Craig Simpson: Hey, Quinton. Good afternoon. Doing well. How are you?
Quentin Silvestro: I'm doing great. For me it's actually evening. I'm in Berlin right now.
Craig Simpson: Are you based in Berlin or are you just there temporarily?
Quentin Silvestro: It's mixed, I would say. We're currently expanding our operations to North America, so it's a bit here and there, but I am originally from Germany and our main office is in Berlin and we are currently having this thing which we call the Office Week, where people actually need to come to the office. Usually I live it's like one and a half hours outside of Berlin.
Craig Simpson: Ah, okay. Understood.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: But yeah, looks like you're. You're at home and not in the office. So I'm glad you're not having to stick around that late.
Quentin Silvestro: No. So the. The actual story is I was in the office and my colleague and I, we decided to go to his place before. I have the call with you so we can make dinner together. So you're basically my last now.
Craig Simpson: Awesome. Well, hopefully it won't keep you too long.
Quentin Silvestro: No, don't worry. I wanted to take the time because I think it's an interesting use case that you guys are. That you guys are looking into and obviously the company is interesting to us. So let's say. Okay, let's take it you're in Florida, right?
Craig Simpson: That's correct. Yeah. So originally I'm from Scotland, but I've been living in Miami now for about six years coming up. Six years in about a month. So yeah, been. Been based here for the entire time since been in the States.
Quentin Silvestro: Crazy. What brought you there?
Craig Simpson: It was. It was work. So working for Maersk back in the UK and then as part of my graduate program at the time we had to go to a different continent.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: And I ended up landing a job over here.
Quentin Silvestro: Oh, crazy.
Craig Simpson: And then just never went home.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I can imagine. The reason me being me asking is because I checked on LinkedIn prior to the call where got where you're based and I saw that you're in Miami. Well, funny story. My family lives in Boca and I use and I visit them. I just came back. I visit them like every other quarter. I'm actually coming back to Miami in a couple of weeks because we are one of the selected partners at the IBM Tech Exchange in Orlando. And we're actually. We're there one of their agentic platforms that they partner with. We use their Watson X model to power workflows with their clients actually. And they invited us to present. We have a Booth and everything. So I'll be back in a couple of weeks. Great.
Craig Simpson: Yes, Sounds good. Well, hopefully there won't be any hurricanes around about that time, but it's getting to that point in the time of year.
Quentin Silvestro: Don't get me started. I was there last year when Helene hit.
Craig Simpson: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Was it. Was it last year? No. Yes, it was.
Craig Simpson: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: That's in October. Yeah, it was kind of shitty. We were going down from Georgia, so we were staying in Savannah actually for a couple of nights, and then we went down the coast the night the storm hit, and then it was. Yeah, come on. It was not the best.
Craig Simpson: Yeah, I can imagine. I know we were very lucky in Miami. It was just a little bit of rain. Yeah. But a little bit of wind. But overall, yeah, we were in the clear. I will say, compared to the west coast of Florida, anyway. Yeah, that's for sure.
Quentin Silvestro: It's terrible. But, yeah, right now, I think the season right now is kinda kind of slow and it's not hitting too hard. Let's. Let's see how it. How it evolves.
Craig Simpson: Yeah. From what I've been reading in terms of history, the big. The cat fives don't generally come until after the 8th of September.
Quentin Silvestro: Is that so?
Craig Simpson: I think. Yeah, yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: I'm coming. And that's where the Cat 5 comes. Okay.
Craig Simpson: Well, I mean, who knows? Who knows? It's. It's.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: No one could predict anything, but, yeah, generally it tends to happen second half of September, October, as opposed to earlier on. And I know hurricane season, I think they've been extending it on both ends every single year, but, yeah, it's generally quiet. June, July. I think they've even moved it into June. But, yeah, July, August, quiet.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: But fingers crossed, we're going to be fine.
Quentin Silvestro: Let's see.
Craig Simpson: You never know.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, let's see. I hope I'm lucky. But let's not talk about hurricanes. Let's talk about agents. You would do me a great favor. I mean, obviously I know the company, but if you can kind of categorize where you sit within this jungle and what you're currently looking into and what made you actually sign up, and then I can take the ball over and introduce you to Beam and the agent that I started building for you today.
Craig Simpson: Yeah, absolutely. So, first of all, give an introduction to myself. So I'm Craig Simpson. As I've kind of alluded to, I've been in the Company quite some time.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool.
Craig Simpson: Been over eight years now in various roles, various locations as well. And most recently, I'm in Our team, called the Global LNS Innovation Team. And what LS means for Maersk is logistics and services. So you've probably heard of Maersk being a shipping company and that is one very large part of our business. But the other arm, you could say is called logistics and services. So it's essentially broken up into the two different parts, ocean being the ocean, and then logistics and services being essentially everything else. So in terms of the supply chain, it's the stuff that happens before the container goes on and gets to the terminal and what happens after the container discharges from the terminal. So an example can be some like, assets or operations such as warehousing, rail truck, air freight. Or it can also be some more, what we'll call product offerings, which can benefit or supplement the supply chain that we provide for our customers. So that could be like internal processes such as procurement, customer service within all these categories, sales within logistics and services, and then more specifically for what we're going or the project that I'm reviewing right now is custom services. So that's another offering that we do provide our customers which, like I said, supplement the overall kind of ship, shipment or shipments throughout the supply chain.
Quentin Silvestro: Just double checking. Sorry if I'm interrupting. You say customer services or custom services.
Craig Simpson: This project is customs services. So like, think about compliance. Yeah, compliance, regulation, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, so sorry, I did mention customer service before that.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, that's what I was like.
Craig Simpson: That's probably why you got confused.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: But yeah, this one in particular is customs services.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, understood.
Craig Simpson: So like thinking about declarations, et cetera, et cetera.
Quentin Silvestro: I see.
Craig Simpson: So as parts of our responsibilities as our team, we review or we take a deep dive into what essentially what problems the business are facing. And that could be the business being any depart team or department that comes under the LNS Logistics and services umbrella. So I mentioned a few different products, operations, et cetera. That could be anything within that. And then being a global team, we also have the responsibility or the scope, I should say, from a geographical, excuse me, perspective as well.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay, understood then.
Craig Simpson: So after we understand, I guess, the problem that each team is facing, we. Well, first of all, we do a thorough review with them to understand what is the actual problem. It could be something much different compared to what they initially think it is. So it's a lot of drilling down into that, spending a lot of time and not just speaking to one person, but maybe multiple people within that team or stakeholders linked to that team as well. But to keep it short, it's the case where we'll also evaluate with respective stakeholders to understand do we have the capabilities, the expertise, the capacity to actually achieve or solve this problem internally. Now generally, given the size of our company, the answer is yes. But there are cases where we might not necessarily tick all those boxes for all those problems. So a large responsibility for our team is to then go outside of the four walls of Maersk to then identify what solutions are out there respective to solving that problem. So we'll do what we call solution scouting, wherein we scour the entire market, well, not the entire market, but spend a good few weeks scouring the market to understand are there anything from a solution perspective acceptable? I would say that we can implement or at least help solve that particular problem. So then the subsequent stage after we select any given partner for any given project will then tend to run a pilot or a proof of concept just to validate, like is this correct? Have we met the critical success criteria? And then after that we would look to then scale this or deploy it elsewhere in other teams or other parts of the business that are facing the same problem. So that's generally where or one of or one of the main responsibilities of our team. And so I can take a pause there before we can speak a little bit more about the use case at hand.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, understood. Okay. How deep are you in the rabbit hole of Genti AI and agents?
Craig Simpson: Yeah, got fairly good understanding. So I know this is like relatively new as of this year. I think it really kicked off for us when we were at a conference in February this year where the buzzword of the day or the weekend or week I should say was agentic AI. So we are fairly up to speed in regard to what agentic AI is, what it can do. And I'll admit we also are implementing this or have implemented various projects across the company internally as well. But going back to what I mentioned about not just the expertise or the capacity, but do we have the resources for this time to do this particular project? Because it might be the case where we have 100 projects just using a random number and we can't necessarily do 100 all at the same time internally. So that's where the question of time to market comes in to say, okay, is there something that can we benefit from going external for any given use case that will allow us to validate this pilot or POC or even get to a workable product before we could achieve that internally speaking?
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, understood. Okay. Reason me asking is basically now I know on what level I need to fly in when I introduce what we do, I'll keep it very, very short and sweet because then I think the best thing is to actually hands on, show you how it works. And I actually started building the use case you sent over already in the platform so we can look at that. Tom Quentin, part of the commercial unit here at bim, actually one of the few early employees that started building our go to market approach. And I essentially say my role within this company is building these agentic journeys together with a client. From basically starting off with one agent which can be a poc and then we roll this out into production and transforming this what we say is an AI native organization. Back in the day everybody was racing towards getting into the web or getting into mobile, which we're basically getting a digital native company. We do see the same inflection point right now when it comes to AI. So I usually work very closely with our partners from exactly what we are doing, the scoping, the beginning up until actually and actual delivery. I'm not a techie but I, I gotten quite, quite deep into it already. Beam, founded three years ago, started building agents right now we do always say we build agents as human like workers. So in the end our platform is a horizontal layer that you plug on top of your current infrastructure and you build agents based on SOPs. So whenever you have a process description we can then transfer this into your little in turn and then we train it on your processes and also we give it live feedback. So we do something which we see as our core USP which is building these self evolving agents that learn from human feedback and actually get better over time. Which is I think a pretty, pretty solid point from a customer standpoint. I think companies that we work with which are in your league are enterprise heavy. One of our clients, Zurich Insurance, one of the largest European insurers then EnBW, it's like a very, very big German energy provider, Lindegas, same there also X Dax company. Then one of these big like these are, this is basically the big enterprise segment. And then we do work with like these very tech saving, tech savvy start slash scale ups. Like for example Trade Republic being the German Robin Hood where we do like onboarding flows over 80,000 new customers a month which is also crazy. And in the end the use cases we do are. It sounds simple but as always we receive a trigger which is the input, we think about it or we use the power of the LLM to reason, to analyze or to draft a report or whatsoever and then we transfer this into an output which I Can also show you in a second in a nutshell, any questions before we go to the use case?
Craig Simpson: Yeah, no questions, but I'm fairly certain there was an internal colleague that was doing a presentation months ago and I think Beam AI came up as an example. This wasn't necessarily linked to my view at all, but I'm sure there was an example. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm sure I saw something about DHL or something along those lines.
Quentin Silvestro: But yeah, it's funny that they mentioned this in this context because this one is not public. Funny, somebody must have told something. But let's bring it back to the use case before I jump to the platform and show you how I started building and mocking because I obviously don't have the tools. Would you mind giving me a very, very high level description how you perceive the use case? And what I need to know is what comes in, what is the type of request, what are the APIs that we need to call the systems that you integrate with and what is the required output. And if I have this I can then continue?
Craig Simpson: Yeah, absolutely. So I think when I initially reviewed this project while speaking with the the custom services stakeholder, to me it was. It potentially could have been something more simple than using Agent Ki. But that's doesn't necessarily change the case here because ultimately they can do the same job at the end of the day.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: So the use case itself is currently we have a customer facing platform called VFI Track. This is an internally built platform dedicated to Maersk. This platform itself is almost like the end of the entire customer services process. So this platform is accessible both by internal colleagues and also our customers as well. Currently the level of experience I'll say that the customer has is fairly limited. Hypothesis is that due to the limited customer experience there is a high likelihood of customer churn as well. So to give you an example, this being the end platform I'll say is ultimately used for customers to access and just review their own information if they want to extract information. Right now it's a case where there's a bunch of dropdown menus to say, okay, this is the filter I want, this is the filter I want. And they have to click a bunch of different filters to export. Right now it's the case where they could be trying to access the data or extract the data for any given reason. But we also have an idea of what type of prompts we would like to see based on a survey that we carried out previously with our customers. But in any case, as it stands, it's very, I would say manual. It's very archaic. And the onus on doing the work is on the customer side in that they have to download the information, export it and then probably they use Excel pivot tables or the likes to get the information that they want to see. Or there could be a case where they're not necessarily able to get the insights that they need because it's a. It's. All it is is just drop down, export Excel. So from the customer side what we're trying or what we're envisaging is a overlay to the existing platform, that being VFI track, wherein there could be a chatbot that the customer can query and ask. Let's just say I've got a list up here in terms of. To give you an idea. Break down all the duties, taxes and fees paid by in this product category. Show all the. What was my last or how much duties did I pay in the last quarter? Has this gone up or down from the previous quarter or something like that? What are my demurrage and detention costs down? Essentially just querying this particular data. I will say the VFI track is the data lake with all this information. So we can assume that there's going to be one source of information for the purposes of this end platform. But there are multiple sources of information that feed into VFI track and so maybe that makes this a little bit easier in that you're not necessarily having to deal with 101 different sources. Everything feeds into VFI track and everything is exported or extracted from the FI track. So from the customer side it's mainly what we're seeing is how it's going to be used for is more ad hoc querying of data. But we would also like the ability for them to be able to create graphs or tables and maybe reports as well to allow them to get a summary of information. All right, so I'll take a pause there.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I have a bunch of questions I like to. I need to find the right. The ones that are actually necessary or critical. We have iTrack. Does it have the APIs available to call and query?
Craig Simpson: This is something I will confirm, but I'm sure we would have.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I mean in the end you just need to give us an endpoint to do the action. How many different varieties of queries do you think on a spectrum of. Is it hundreds or two digits?
Craig Simpson: Yeah, it could ultimately be hundreds, but when we're talking about the pilot or POC, the Customs Services stakeholder provided me the top 10. Yeah, this, this is something that we would absolutely want to see if we could validate. We might not even need the top 10 for the pilot, but if we could at least validate most of them, then that's exactly something that we're trying to get to. So that's something we can discuss down the line.
Quentin Silvestro: I see.
Craig Simpson: Yeah, I mean it's really up to the end user. We don't necessarily know everything that our customers want to know and we don't necessarily track everything that they ask for. But in other cases it might be the case where instead of the customer trying to extract this data, they'll probably send us an email or call us and say, hey, can you provide me this information? So then that leads to more work on our end and it's more friction as well from the customer side.
Quentin Silvestro: I see. Follow up question. Do you. Let's say I query one of these top 10, when do I expect a response? Do I need to have an answer instant, like chat style or could I send something async?
Craig Simpson: I think if we're talking about a report, it'd be fine if there was some form of time delay that maybe you could send directly to the customer's email.
Quentin Silvestro: I. Yeah, something like that.
Craig Simpson: Question. If it was a simple query of, you know, how much duties have I paid in the last quarter, I would hope that there would be more of an instant answer. But if we're talking about creating a report that shows XYZ and then the trend of, you know, 1, 2, 3, then I, you know, if it's easier that it takes some time or not easier, but if it's more accurate that it takes some time and then sends directly to their email, then maybe that's just as good a customer experience or customer journey as opposed to populating within the chat itself. But that's something I can, I can go back to my colleague Mark on that one just to see like what would he think? But this is just my perspective on it.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Because the reason why I'm asking is a free float conversational agent that queries something and then gets back. Instant might look fancy and cool, but the hard reality is doesn't work. Especially if we're talking about big amounts of data and different varieties of lookups. We need to query and actually reason. So there might be actual scenarios where the agent does something and then thinks, okay, this was not right, I need to query this as well and ultimately come to a solution. Generate the report and send this and this loop time might take up to five minutes. That's roughly the the loop time that we do see with agentic workflows that it can get up to five minutes, but it obviously also can can be way shorter. So we do need to map out the actual process to see on what type of queries we can give instant response and of what type of queries we can sent in. Maybe starting with an Excel but evolving into an actual dashboard async to the client after five minutes. It can also be as easy that we display just a visual of what he has. So there's a lot of lot of ways in which we can think. But it's important to understand the requirements, the expectation from the custom service rep or the manager that you were talking to, what is his expectation and how fast an incident do we need to report.
Craig Simpson: I think another aspect that they mentioned is if we're talking about the report specific. Given that we are very much heavily tied towards Microsoft, we're currently using Power BI to generate reports. If there was a case where there was something like paginated reports from Power BI or something similar, maybe you have a preferred source or not source for that, preferred endpoint for that, then we're very much open to anything really. It's not. We don't need to focus solely on Power BI for example, but if it was something like that, then ultimately we just want to be able to see the reports or have something. It could even be as simple as a PDF as well. That's something that we're open to as well. Before we go into the demo and I know we've got five minutes left from the internal side, we also want the capability similar idea in that we query the data. The purpose of the internal colleagues querying the data is that we have to carry out quite a lot of qbr so quarterly business reviews for our customers. Right now, essentially the process is the same for the internal colleague in that they're having to go through the drop down box, click all the filters they need, extract the information and then go into Excel and then start populating tables via that way. If there was a way that we could create say paginated reports by querying the data, we do see a massive time saving by that in that it could take upwards of 10 hours for the internal colleague right now to do all these. I think there's four different segments that they generally look at. But if there was a way to cut that down to say 15 minutes just by querying the information and getting that report.
Quentin Silvestro: Certainly yes, getting the report like that.
Craig Simpson: Then we see that as A massive win from the internal perspective too. So there's like two goals that we're trying to achieve, I guess you could say. But ultimately the process is the same.
Quentin Silvestro: Certainly. I do have multiple paths in my head. I mean, you mentioned Power bi, we do have a Power BI API, we do have integration, integrations into the whole Microsoft Suite. So this shouldn't be a problem. We could go even one step further and actually build visual appealing reports. Not within Power bi, but within another third party software. It doesn't really matter in the end. It can also be as easy as a PDF because in the end you just need to tell us where you want the data to look, how, and that's what we can do with the agent. What we need to do is map out the decision tree, basically. And this is what I was showing you in a second, by the way. Do you have a hard bounce in five?
Craig Simpson: I don't know. No, I've got more time if you do.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, me too. Okay, so I'll give you a very, very, very short rundown of the platform and then we can jump into questions and maybe other topics. So in the end, you see, I created a workspace for you. You're now in your Merck workspace. I added a agent, which I more or less think is like 40, 40 to 50% of the workflow that you described via the email. And I created a typical customer service agent for you, so you start to understand how agents work. Now, in the end, if we look at your agent, let's I call it the VFI Customs AI agent. It works on tasks. So you see here, 30 minutes before the call, I decided to give it some test runs on queries, for example. So here I think I gave him a customer query, which was what was my total duty spent last quarter by port or entry? Port of entry. I don't know if this is an actual query that it would look like, but this is just what I imagined that might actually be true. And then the agent will start working on these tasks just like your little intern got the query. And it's now going to look. So in the first step, it's going to do the query intake, it's then going to do the data retrieval, it then generates the insights and then ultimately delivers this back into VFI track. You do see little Merc symbols. This is obviously now mocked by me for the demo. What I did here is I mapped out the flow and this is what I was referring to the SOP in the beginning, where I need to know your desired process. And then I can start mapping it out. And if I maybe want to have a decision tree here, I can add a condition and tell it if this, then that. And I can also add steps. So what I did is I generated tools and then I gave it a nice little Maersk logo and told him what to do. And now the agent, whenever I trigger him. So let's say I want to create a task. What would be a query? Do you have one there that I can just give it a shot or a jab at.
Craig Simpson: What we got. If this helps. What was the percentage of entries that required correction?
Quentin Silvestro: Correction.
Craig Simpson: Correction, yeah. So there was a mistake or something was missing.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So you see, I now created this task manually. Usually we do define a trigger which sets the agent to work. In this case, this trigger would be a chat interface. So what you're seeing right now is basically the back bone or the machinery room where the agent actually works. It is a workflow builder where we can build a chain of prompts which are either API based, so we get or we post something, or they are LLM based where we in this case need to generate in generate the insights, which is a typical LLM prompt. And behind this there are tools. And this is what you see here. So here's the foundational model. In this case we used GPT 4.0. We also use a lot of cloth because it's actually better with their current MCP release. And then behind this there is a big prompt that is automatically created by the platform. And right now I would go into this prompt to adjust it and either increase accuracy or actually change the output of what I would want to do. So coming back to what I was saying, so we mapped out the flow based on what you gave me prior to the call. I mocked something out of which what I thought is right and I queried the agent, you see 19 or 7, 58. This is what I did one minute ago and he now says, okay, I need something from you. So obviously the agent doesn't know what he needs to do because I mocked it and didn't really gave him the APIs and trained him on your actual flow. So now my little intern, it did the first step. So the query intake was successful. And you do see the input of the query, which is exactly what was the percentage of entries that required correction. And now he's going to take this to pursue further, which now he needs to do a data retrieval into, you call it, I think the CHB data.
Craig Simpson: Custom size brokerages, chb.
Quentin Silvestro: I obviously don't have this. So he runs into a problem. So he asked me something and tells me, okay, give me the API. What we would now do is we would create a custom integration. As you do see, we do actually have 1600 endpoints that we can connect already. These are is basically the big enterprise tech stack or in the case that you have a custom tool which you see right here, we can just enable it via the API key. That's why I was asking for the API key. Or is there an API available so we can start enabling the endpoints and allowing our agent to actually create query or to actually do what I, what we want him to do. And then this flow would have then actually worked. What I also did just for Mark, I said for example, show all shipments last month flagged for custom exam or missing documents. Go somewhat into the direction that we were talking about. I mocked this and then it's, it goes into straight through processing because I just told him to skip this step where he does data retrieval because he obviously doesn't has it. And then ultimately he gives me something. So I hope you start to understand how agents work. It's in the end a chain of prompts that work together with API calls to give us the result that we want for this. We just need to know what do you want to see and what integrations do you want us to call and then we can start build it for you. Maybe I pause here for a second or wait a second, I will show you the analytics as well because this is quite cool. And then you can also see the complete oversight on what the agent did. So you see he has two tasks completed. The completion rate in this case is 100% because there were no errors. And then you can also see an accuracy score. What is the accuracy score based on what you train us or what you tell us? We're going to train the agent on a so called golden data set. This is basically the last hundred queries that you got. And we're going to map the best case human output against this. So we basically map this as 100% accuracy. And then every time an agent does an output, we're going to validate his output based on the golden data set and then we can give it a very, very strong accuracy measure. And this is also the accuracy measure which we are going to train our agent on. Because if I now go in one of these tasks, I'm in the wrong page. If I now go into one of these tools, you see I can optimize the tool and I can now give feedback And I can even give it not just thumbs up, thumbs down. I can also I'm in the wrong screen screen go to one of these actual tasks and give it not just thumbs up, thumbs down, but even more reasoning why something was good and why something was bad here. So and based on this human feedback, we're then going to learn and the agent will be self evolving towards. In current enterprise projects we see 90, 95% accuracy even more sometimes. But now I make a break. Feel free to ask as many questions as you have.
Craig Simpson: So something you just brought up there is my understanding correct that okay, we're starting with say the top 10 prompts, but over time we won't necessarily have to give you every single prompt that we ever envisage a customer asking or do we have to do that?
Quentin Silvestro: No.
Craig Simpson: Or is this self evolving part where it starts to learn basis on some other or an aggregation of all the previous prompts it then knows or has an understanding of what the next prompt would mean.
Quentin Silvestro: Two answers. One is the data that we're going to train the agent on can be the last thousand queries that you got. And we just give him this as historic data. And what the human being answered, we just have the input output pairs. So he has this as his knowledge. And then every time he encounters a question that he never seen before and he's not, he's not sure, he can just go ahead and ask the actual human operator and escalate it and ask for advice. And the second you're going to give him the answer, he's going to take this into his repository and learn from it. And this is what we, and this is what we, what we envision. And then where was I heading? I think this is also important to show. This now looks as straight through processing very autonomous agents. But that's not the real reality because in the reality in the beginning of a project, we're going to have the agent and human in loop. So every time before you actually send something, we're going to have the human look over it. If we are not, if we're unsure to ensure that it's not doing any false responses. For example, there are customers which are very confident, as I mentioned this the European Robinhood that we're working with, they just say let it run and we patch it in the background. But there are also enterprise clients, like for example, the insurance I was mentioning, if something goes wrong, it can go terribly wrong. So they do have three safety nets before they actually send something out. So there are certain safety nets to ensure Residencies in these setups. Okay, long answer to your short question. I'm sorry, no problem.
Craig Simpson: And then you were showing one of the screens that you can tap into various LLMs.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: And when you said oh we can change that. Is that the case where during the process we the onus would be on us to like change the LLM depending on the. The accuracy or generally do you just use the same LLM for this particular use case regardless of what the query is?
Quentin Silvestro: I'm laughing sorry because my colleague brought me an ice cold Coke Zero. I love it for dinner. So in the end I think where we need to go is how we work together with our clients is very very much a partnership approach especially within a poc. It is to a validate each other as a partner but also to transfer knowledge into your organization on how to build these agents and how to build these setups. So the answer is in the beginning it's very likely that we will do it together with you. So it's always a done with you approach and we also advise you on what be the best. For example for your query it wouldn't make any sense to start experimenting with. I said I was mentioning IBM in the beginning to experimenting with their what's an X AI we would go with GPT because it's usually just the best but this is what we know and we also hatch these LLMs against each other. So for example we know that there are LLMs for example mix from from France. They're very good at latency. There's a second we need very quick and swift responses. We're going to use that model because it's just better at it. And to sum it up it's very, very much partnership driven and it's not like we use the platform and have fun but we actually take your hand on this journey and help you to get towards your goal. And this is also to be quite transparent. The most collaborations we have with enterprise clients are a software subscription and partnership but B also time and material of our forward deployed engineers that sit with you in the office going to take down all of the processes and then ultimately try to translate this into our agents and also transfer this knowledge into your organism organization.
Craig Simpson: Yeah, perfect. That's, that's good to hear. I think well from, from my end, I think further down the line if this is a route that we want to go in and I'll say like taking a step back in terms of where I am with this process. I mentioned about doing solution scouting so I am looking at various companies out there. Yeah, I haven't got to the point where I've made a decision at all. I think you're actually one of the first folks that I've spoken to. But I think another aspect that could be or will become relevant if we do decide to move forward with this is to involve not only the stakeholder, that being Mark and the customer services team, but we also have our internal platform and tech team who I think we'll be working together with in terms of what either what's support they need or what support we need from them and also what the requirements would be thinking example being like the sandbox environment that how do we overlay the, the chat bot into VFI track? That's something I'm actually going to find out a little bit more information tomorrow. But there might be an instance where they themselves, the platform tech team might be interested in a follow up conversation with you as well. Even before we go ahead and take committing we're going to do a pilot, they might have some more relevant questions from say the tech side that I might not be the expert on to ask. So if you were open to that. I'm not saying there is a definitive time dates etc, I still need to pose the or have the call with them. Yeah, but if that is something that you as a company would be open to doing then I think that would be a great next step as well.
Quentin Silvestro: Sure, sure. I mean very, very happy to sit down and do a little tech talk and do an extensive demo. I will then bring Bennett, he's our cpo. He's actually built this whole system and he can share every story and how everything works 100 better than I do. So we are very open to that and happy to go down that route and in the end tell us what you need and we'll make it happen. So usually how we go from here this is like the little touch point. I validate that your use case makes sense. You validate us as a potential, as a potential vendor partner. And from here what we usually do is we go one level deeper actually what you just said, build the demo a bit better and then do a tech demo session with your corresponding stakeholders. Then probably we need to do a session with your business stakeholder, which is the customs representative to actually deeply understand how the workflow sits and what, what we need to do. And then we are at the point where we say let's go into a poc. Usually the POC with us consists out of two sprints which are each six weeks. The first six Weeks we're going to do a lot of prototyping and actual agent building. So we're, I'm going to send this all to you after. So the tomorrow, tomorrow morning, Eastern time, you will have something in your inbox, little presentation and a recap of what we discussed today. But what I was saying is Sprint one is prototyping, actual building the agent. So after six weeks you will have a custom prototype. That is what we understand the process and it will actually start creating value already. If we would want to not do it in the sandbox, obviously we can do it in a sandbox. And then the second Sprint is all about the accuracy and optimization and actually the evolving part that I was mentioning to show you the actual magic sauce on how this agent can evolve and learn and meeting the KPIs of the POC. So this is a 12 months, 12 weeks package program that we do with enterprise clients. You will have one forward deployed engineer that sits with you and actually access your sparings and counterpart. And then at the end of, after these 12 weeks you have something to validate and defend internally to say, okay, this is actually something that we would want to become secure.
Craig Simpson: Right, Right. Great. And I'm thinking now that you're, you just outlined that, you know, six weeks and six weeks and you could argue that we've got two use cases and one. One being the customer facing aspect.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: And one being the internally facing aspect. And I think from say a risk perspective then it might make sense to do the prototyping and testing internally because ultimately we could be querying the same data or prompting the same data or using the same prompts as what the customer would ask. But I'm just, I'm thinking more like out loud here.
Quentin Silvestro: No, very fair, very fair point. You're actually sparking an idea in my head because with one of our other enterprise clients that we're currently in, the POC process is. You're doing exactly what you just said. We start with an internal POC where we only build something for the internal use. And the second we validate this and hit the KPIs and the satisfaction of the business owner, we're then going to make this, roll this out to the externals so they can start using us as well. So by this they de risk that something goes wrong and keep the validation internally. And then if they're confident they will roll it out. This is something we can, we can do. In the end, we're very flexible. So is our platform and so are we. So we make it work to what. To what you need. And yeah, if you. Is the team based out of Florida as well?
Craig Simpson: Not Florida, but they're in the states. The majority of them should be on the east coast as well. But I, I don't know for certain. At least the main stakeholder is based on the east Coast.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So if you, if the timeline sounds like something that is feasible, we are going to be doing a little roadshow in October around that. Around that event. So we could even work towards that timeline to have something ready to actually present to the stakeholder on in person as well. We do have an office in New York if that's relevant. And I'm in Florida a lot. So just so you know how we work, this is also something we can do.
Craig Simpson: And like since we're talking about PoCs generally what, what is the price for the PoC? And then we don't necessarily need to discuss this today but in terms of like what does this look like from a deployment perspective as well? If you have like a structure towards that, that would be at least good to have a general understanding on.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So for these POCs we do see the value in the longer term partnership. So we don't hang the biggest price tag on these list prices. 25,000 USD for this three months program. Between you and me, obviously we can work with budget hurdles. We know that enterprise have certain limits that work and if you tell me the number, you can make this work as well. Okay.
Craig Simpson: Yeah. We don't necessarily have a defined budget right now. That's more. It becomes more relative to the use case once we start getting an idea of the solutions out there then. But I think from a budget perspective in general, our team have a like a yearly budget for all of our projects and we never necessarily get to a point where we're tapped out. We still need approval, you could say for each and every project. But it's not the case where we only have say $5,000 for this particular project. And then generally speaking as well, when we'd run a poc, we also tried to, I wouldn't say negotiate but align with the business side as well. Where in half the cost would come from us and half the cost would come from them.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. Split innovation budget and business center. Right.
Craig Simpson: Higher buy in.
Quentin Silvestro: I see. No, I understand. And in the end I'm a friend of transparency. So just tell me what you need and tell me what you need to make it work and you'll. We'll figure something out. Just out of curiosity, as you said you were Solution scoping Actually before I joined the company I was doing something very much like you were doing. We were working for an innovation fund for corporates where I did the same thing. I was scouting for problem statements that they had and scouting innovative startups out there. So I know in what seat you're in. What are the. Do you already have any other agentix platform shortlisted that you want to talk to? So I obviously have an opinion about them, that's why.
Craig Simpson: Yeah, I mean I've just been kind of going like a bit of a shotgun approach right now. Some of them we're looking at in terms of can we tap their platform and do it ourselves. So think about like Copilot Studio or Amazon Bedrock for example. There's a. Just some other ones that have been coming up on more so like Pitchbook than anything else related to yourself. I even had IBM what's next. But I think based on what you're saying, and I think this is a great point of I was raising to speak to the tech team as well for you to actually give your not recommendation but build a business case to say this is why we should use not necessarily yourselves about Beam AI, but more so this is why we should use this particular LLM. Or just why like you know, speak to more of the why. I think there's a greater buy in from there and there's another company pedestal. Senbert. Yeah, I think I had one, a Zumo which isn't necessarily the same, kind of comes under the same banner. But what at this stage is I'm keeping my mind open to say okay, it doesn't matter what your solution is, it's more about the process and there's 101 ways to solve the problem.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I agree.
Craig Simpson: So yeah as well.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, cohere. You said cohere. Yeah, it's One of the LLMs that we use for Rack based actions. It's actually the LLM that we use to do very long context retrieval. So think of for example a thousand pages PDF. Cohere is really good at understanding long context. So this is what I said in the, in the, in the demo where I said we hatch the LLMs against each other. The LLM is actually just the. See it as the engine of an origentic system where it powers the agent but the actual magic is within the workflow orchestration and making this deterministic system better. And by making it better we use the right or we plug and play the right models. So cohere is basically one small part of the bigger ecosystem. But it's good that you mentioned this. So I can give you a two liner on these companies that you mentioned in the follow up or basically I can share my view on the competitive landscape if this helps.
Craig Simpson: Amazing. Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Yes.
Craig Simpson: And then Sligo. Have you heard of Sligo AI?
Quentin Silvestro: I haven't heard. I will check them out.
Craig Simpson: They're a multi agent platform as well and not specific like chatbot. But yeah, maybe you can have some time on your end to do a little bit digging. As far as I'm aware they don't have a whole lot of information on their website if I can recall correctly. But we've been speaking with them for other projects in the past as well so thought it might be a good idea to at least give them an opportunity to speak. And then Patchworks as well. That's more of a. Yeah, established company.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: But yeah, I think. Did I say a Zumo? I did, I think yeah you did.
Quentin Silvestro: You did. I, I'm writing them down.
Craig Simpson: Yeah. Decagon, I think that was up there too.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah.
Craig Simpson: And I think that was it for now. I'm trying to do this in a bit of a like a quicker manner, not, not going by like waterfall approach. I'm going okay, find a company speak type thing.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah, I will, I will give you a take on these and how we differentiate and give you a very honest, honest response. Obviously take it with a bias but if that shortens your, shortens your decision making and it will obviously also shorten our potential collaboration. That's why I'll give you my two cents. And then in the end, and then we can, we can wrap it up. What I would recommend to do is don't only zoom in onto this small use case which is now customs or VFI for example because in the end these agentic systems like us, we are use case agnostic and we do see the penetration basically in the whole company. So what we do envision is to be like the Microsoft that has its fingers in every department on every different use case. And this is also what we do think because in the end you can the hard pitches. We can replace human labor in every department and this is what we do in vision. So we, we going to start with this case and this is going to be your first agent in this, in this system. But then over time you will start plugging in agents in the right moments and you evolve towards what we then call the native organization. So it's very much horizontal, not vertical how we view it. And that was my one thought that I had and I think I lost the second one. It will come back if it was important.
Craig Simpson: Yeah, no, I think we're aligned on that point as well. And that's the beauty of our role as well. When I mentioned we cover all the LNs. Yes. So we're not just today we're speaking about customs, but at the end of the day we look at something in terms of can this solution work for other areas and kind of streamline our process going forward in that. Okay, next week we could be speaking to procurement on. They have a similar, not a similar problem. They have a unique problem, but it could be solved in a similar way. So yeah, that's, that's something that of course we do because it makes, like I said, it streamlines our process. It makes it easier for us to.
Quentin Silvestro: Maybe now that you mentioned it, let me drop or let me just share a couple thoughts on this and then we can really wrap it up. So most of the use cases that we see within these big enterprises, just like you are within, I would say three, three value chains. One value chain is the whole. We call it order to cash. I have an order or sales order that I need to get paid ultimately and if it's not paid, I need to collect it. So there's internal sales order creation, order confirmation. Then I need to actually retrieve the po. Then I need to match the PO to the, to the invoice. Then ultimately I have an invoice that I create that the invoice needs to be reconciled if the transaction is ultimately in our bank statement or not. And after reconciliation, if there's not paid, there's reminders, dunning and collection. So this flow, it's the order to cash value chain which we do the most of the work in, which involves sales, payables and receivables. Then we do a lot in customer service which is basically first level support. And it can be as easy@infoersk.com gets 10,000 emails or collective email boxes that needs to be triaged. Okay, this is spam. This gets out, filtered out. This is sales. This goes the other here. Customer service goes here and invoice goes there. These low level use cases where most of the companies just like you are or think of everything that you have a GBS for or a shared service center. Like if you do have global business services somewhere or a shared service center or even a bpo, a business process outsourcing unit that you use in India or the Philippines, these are the use cases that you would that you, that we do the most because that's where you can leverage the most value. And if I say leveraging value, it's two pillars or three. Top level or top line. Can I make more revenue or can I, can I reduce backlog and with this retrieve more cash flow? This, this is one pillar. Pillar two is cost cutting. If you're being honest. Can I cut costs by replacing human labor or cutting out my bpo? And the pillar three is, I would say I like to pitch it as talent density or employee efficiency. Can I. Where can I shift my human labor towards more value creating tasks instead of doing this low level repetitive work? And these are the three pillars that we look into. Okay, now I talked a lot. I'll stop. Is it realistic?
Craig Simpson: No, I think yeah, we do have just an over. Way over time. But I will say and I mentioned at the top of the call, we do have a large workforce who are doing things like this internally. But it's just a case where we don't have enough people to do everything.
Quentin Silvestro: Yeah. So you have to start somewhere.
Craig Simpson: Exactly.
Quentin Silvestro: Is it realistic that we can organize something like this tech call next week or is it a bit too fast for you?
Craig Simpson: Yeah. So let me have this call with the tech team tomorrow just to see where they are and then basis on the outcome of that call then potentially next week could work. I think for my, for my agenda I would like to do it sometime next week. But what I can do, I'll need to speak with the internal folks first to understand like how do we go about doing this. But on the back of that I can reach out to you before the end of the week, the next step.
Quentin Silvestro: Of course. What time do you have your internal call tomorrow?
Craig Simpson: It's at 9 or 8:30. And the morning.
Quentin Silvestro: In the morning.
Craig Simpson: Yeah.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay.
Craig Simpson: So I make sure these folks will be. Yeah, they're based in India or Denmark or both.
Quentin Silvestro: Okay. So I will make sure that you have my follow up and all the material you need for that call before your call with the internal team and you have some time to review. So I will make, I will do everything first thing tomorrow morning. So you have it in your inbox before the call.
Craig Simpson: Some appreciate that.
Quentin Silvestro: Cool. All right then.
Craig Simpson: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Quentin Silvestro: Thank you for time and interest. Great conversation and looking forward. Yep.
Craig Simpson: Cheers. Enjoy your evening.
Quentin Silvestro: Thanks man. Bye.
Craig Simpson: See you later. Bye. Bye.
Quentin Silvestro: Sick. That sounded like it went very well. Yeah. Dude, Mersk. Yeah, it's ridiculous. You sound very excited. You spoke almost an hour. Please. Red.
