## EMAIL CONTENT

Hi team,

Thank you for the thorough 3-hour evaluation session yesterday. Rather than send you more information, I want to directly address the three main concerns we heard from your team.

### **Your Power BI Investment**

We heard clearly from Mitch and Bas that you've invested significantly in Power BI and don't want to replicate existing dashboards. You're absolutely right - throwing away that investment would be terrible advice.

**Our approach**: We can prioritize deploying the cockpit view directly in Power BI. Here's how we'd approach this:

**Step A**: We need to understand your current Power BI setup better to make the right technical decision within its boundaries. Specifically:
- Your current Power BI architecture and data connections
- Refresh capabilities and real-time data requirements  
- Custom visual capabilities and integration constraints
- User permissions and dashboard distribution setup

**Step B**: We can still pursue the custom dashboard path if we determine that Power BI cannot deliver sufficient integration and display capabilities for the transaction monitoring cockpit we want to achieve together.

**Bottom line**: Power BI first, custom interface only if technically necessary. We adapt to your investment, not the other way around.

### **Analyst Adoption & Training**

Rina, your concern about analyst training and adoption is spot-on. You said "we need to develop a training plan for these analysts" - you're absolutely right, and we've seen too many great tools fail because people simply don't use them.

**Our approach**: "Train the trainers" methodology
- We establish a small expert group of power users during the POV
- We train them intensively on the system (4-6 hours total)
- They become your internal champions who train the broader organization
- This ensures adoption comes from trusted colleagues, not external vendors
- Your experts understand your specific workflows and can adapt training accordingly

**Result**: Sustainable, internal adoption capability that doesn't depend on us long-term.

### **Complexity Concerns**

Bas, you asked "are we over-engineering this?" - that's exactly the right question. You want simple tools that work, not complex AI systems requiring dedicated expertise.

**Our approach**:
- Analysts see better insights, not AI complexity
- All the intelligent processing happens invisibly in the background  
- Simple approve/adjust/submit workflow
- No need to understand prompts, tokens, or AI mechanics

**Bottom line**: If your analysts need to think about AI, we've failed. They should just see better, faster insights.

### **Next Steps**

I know you're evaluating other suppliers this week. What I can promise is that we've heard your specific concerns and we're addressing them directly, not giving you generic AI capabilities presentations.

If any of these three areas need deeper discussion - especially understanding your Power BI setup better - I'm available for follow-up calls this week.

Best regards,
[Your name]
