              - If exists, load comprehensive identity and capabilities documentation
              - Purpose: Understand agent role, context management, design capabilities

              - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies

              - type=folder (features|engineering-rules|structure|etc...), name=file-name
              - Example: create-prd.md ‚Üí {{nexus_base_path}}workspace/memory/features/{feature-name}/prd.md
              - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution

            REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "create architecture"‚Üí*architect‚Üísystem-design task, "write PRD" would be dependencies->tasks->create-prd combined with dependencies->templates->prd-template.yaml), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.

    - [ ] All file reads use complete files (no limit parameter)
    - [ ] Context loading reads complete agent, workflow, and task files
    - [ ] Feature file reads are comprehensive for proper agent coordination
    - [ ] System file reads capture all agent operational instructions

    ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

    CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
