      <!-- 🔴 DIRECTIVE #1 ENFORCEMENT: ALWAYS READ COMPLETE FILES -->
      <!-- CRITICAL: This task reads multiple files for execution - never use limit parameter -->
      <!-- This directive OVERRIDES token conservation - read files completely -->
      <!-- VIOLATION = Missing critical task execution steps and validation processes -->

      ## 🔴 PRE-TASK DIRECTIVE CHECK
      **MANDATORY**: Before executing this task, verify:
      - [ ] All file reads will use complete files (no limit parameter)
      - [ ] Engineering rule file reads will be comprehensive
      - [ ] Context file reads will provide complete task execution environment
      - [ ] Template and resource file reads will capture all specifications

      **Complexity**: {simple/standard/complex}
      **Prerequisites**: {prerequisite_list}

      ## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

      ### **THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

      When this task is invoked:

      1. **MANDATORY ENGINEERING RULES LOADING** - Load all required engineering rules before execution
      2. **HIERARCHY RESPECT** - Apply top-level rules, then repository-specific overrides  
      3. **COMPLIANCE VALIDATION** - All outputs must comply with loaded engineering rules
      4. **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION** - Follow step-by-step workflow with user validation
      5. **QUALITY GATE INTEGRATION** - Engineering rules compliance checked at each gate

      **VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you skip rule loading or bypass compliance validation, you have violated this workflow.

      ```

      ### Validation Requirements

      **Pre-Execution Validation:**
      - [ ] Load and review relevant checklist: `.checklists/{task-domain}-checklist.md`
      - [ ] Validate prerequisites using appropriate quality gates
      - [ ] Confirm context accessibility and engineering rules compliance

      **Quality Gates During Execution:**

  # EXECUTION WORKFLOW WITH RULE INTEGRATION
  execution_workflow:
    format: |
      ## Task Execution Workflow

      ### Step 1: Engineering Rules Loading & Validation

      **Rule Loading Sequence:**

      1. **Load Primary Rules** (Always Required)
         ```bash
         {{#each primary_rules}}
         - Read .engineeringrules/{{rule_file}}
         - Parse {{rule_aspects}}
         {{/each}}
         ```

      2. **Context-Based Rule Loading**
         ```yaml
         rule_loading_logic:
           {{#each contextual_loading}}
           {{condition_name}}:
             condition: {{condition}}
             load: {{rule_files}}
             apply_to: {{application_scope}}
           {{/each}}
         ```

      3. **Repository-Specific Rule Loading**
         ```yaml
         repository_detection:
           current_repository: {detect_from_pwd_or_context}
           additional_rules_path: {current_repository}/.engineeringrules/
           loading_pattern:
             - load: repository_specific_rules
             - merge_with: top_level_rules  
             - priority: repository_overrides_top_level
         ```

      **Engineering Rules Validation** 🔴

      Present loaded rules summary to user:

      **Loaded Engineering Rules:**
      {{#each rule_categories}}
      - ✅ **{{category_name}}**: {{rule_summary}}
      {{/each}}

      **Rule Application Confirmation:**

      1. **Apply all loaded rules** - Use all standards throughout task
      2. **Selective application** - Choose which rules to prioritize  
      3. **Rule customization** - Modify standards for this specific task
      4. **Add additional rules** - Load more engineering rules
      5. **Repository override** - Prioritize repository-specific rules
      6. **Minimal compliance** - Apply only essential standards
      7. **Quality level adjustment** - Adjust rigor based on project phase
      8. **Stakeholder alignment** - Modify rules based on requirements
      9. **Custom rule interpretation** - Provide specific guidance

      **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Ensure rule application approach confirmed.

      ### Step 2: Task Context Gathering with Rule Application

      **Context Gathering with Engineering Rules Awareness:**

      Based on loaded engineering rules, gather context:

      **Current Understanding:**
      - **Task Objective**: {{task_objective}}
      - **Engineering Standards**: {{loaded_standards_summary}}
      - **Quality Requirements**: {{quality_requirements_from_rules}}
      - **Compliance Scope**: {{compliance_scope}}

      **Rule-Informed Validation Questions:**

      1. **Scope vs Standards** - "Given our {{engineering_standards}}, what scope is realistic?"
      2. **Quality vs Timeline** - "Our rules require {{quality_level}}, does timeline allow?"
      3. **Repository Context** - "Are we working in {{repository_name}} with its specific rules?"
      4. **Compliance Level** - "What level of rule compliance is required? (1-9 scale)"
      5. **Rule Exceptions** - "Any engineering rules that need to be waived or modified?"
      6. **Integration Points** - "How do {{integration_rules}} apply to this task?"
      7. **Validation Approach** - "How should we validate compliance during execution?"
      8. **Documentation Requirements** - "What documentation do {{doc_rules}} require?"
      9. **Quality Gate Rigor** - "How strictly should we apply quality gates?"

      **MANDATORY:** Present as numbered list, wait for user response.

      ### Step 3: {{task-specific}} Task Execution

      **Task-Specific Implementation:**

      Based on loaded engineering rules and validated context, execute the task:

      **Implementation Workflow:**
      {{#each implementation_steps}}
      {{step_number}}. **{{step_name}}**
         - **Objective**: {{step_objective}}
         - **Engineering Rules Applied**: {{applicable_rules}}
         - **Quality Gate**: {{quality_validation}}
         - **Context Updates**: {{context_update_requirements}}
      {{/each}}

      **Task Progress Tracking:**
      ```yaml
      progress_tracking:
        step_completion:
          - trigger: "step_{{step_number}}_complete"
            update: ".memory/features/{feature-name}/progress.md"
            content: "Step {{step_number}} completed, deliverables, next step ready"
          
        milestone_tracking:
          - trigger: "major_milestone_reached"
            update: ".memory/features/{feature-name}/active-context.md"
            content: "Milestone status, accumulated deliverables, remaining work"
      ```

  # QUALITY GATES WITH ENGINEERING RULES COMPLIANCE
  quality_gates_integration:
    format: |
      ### Quality Gate: Engineering Rules Compliance

      **Compliance Assessment Framework:**

      ```yaml
      compliance_assessment:
        {{#each rule_categories}}
        {{category_id}}:
          rules_source: {{rule_file}}
          criteria: {{compliance_criteria}}
          evidence_required: {{evidence_types}}
          assessment_method: {{assessment_approach}}
          pass_threshold: {{pass_criteria}}
        {{/each}}
      ```

      **Detailed Compliance Check:**

      {{#each rule_categories}}
      #### {{category_name}} Compliance

      **Criteria from {{rule_source}}:**
      {{#each criteria}}
      - {{criterion_description}}
      {{/each}}

      **Evidence Collection:**
      - [ ] {{evidence_item_1}}
      - [ ] {{evidence_item_2}}
      - [ ] {{evidence_item_3}}

      **Assessment**: {PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED}
      **Evidence Summary**: {evidence_documentation}
      **Compliance Notes**: {specific_compliance_details}

      {{/each}}

      **Engineering Rules Quality Decision** 🔴

      Based on compliance assessment, select overall status:

      1. **FULL COMPLIANCE** - All engineering rules met, proceed
      2. **COMPLIANT with Documentation** - Rules met, document any minor deviations
      3. **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE** - Core rules met, mitigation plan for others
      4. **NON-COMPLIANT with Justification** - Rules not met but business justified
      5. **WAIVED by Stakeholder** - Rules waived with documented approval  
      6. **DEFER COMPLIANCE** - Will address compliance in future iteration
      7. **RULE MODIFICATION REQUEST** - Request engineering rule updates
      8. **ESCALATION REQUIRED** - Need architectural review for rule conflicts
      9. **CUSTOM COMPLIANCE APPROACH** - Define specific compliance strategy

      **If non-compliant selected, MANDATORY documentation:**
      - **Specific Violations**: {list_rule_violations}
      - **Business Justification**: {business_or_technical_reasoning}
      - **Risk Assessment**: {risk_level_and_impact}
      - **Mitigation Strategy**: {how_risks_will_be_addressed}
      - **Stakeholder Approval**: {approval_status_and_documentation}
      - **Future Remediation**: {plan_for_future_compliance}
