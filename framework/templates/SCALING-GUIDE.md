# Template Scaling & Evolution Guide

## üöÄ How Templates Scale in Nexus

Every template in this system is designed to evolve with your usage. This guide explains how each template type scales and when to evolve them.

## üìä Scaling Patterns by Template Type

### 1. Feature Templates (`features/*.yaml`)

#### Starting Point (0-5 features)
```yaml
simple_feature:
  prd: "Basic requirements"
  progress: "Simple tracking"
  quality_gates: "Basic validation"
```

#### Scaling Up (5-20 features)
```yaml
evolving_feature:
  prd: "Detailed requirements with acceptance criteria"
  progress: "Milestone-based tracking"
  quality_gates: "Multi-phase validation"
  dependencies: "Cross-feature tracking"
  metrics: "Performance indicators"
```

#### Enterprise Scale (20+ features)
```yaml
enterprise_feature:
  prd: "Comprehensive specs with stakeholder matrix"
  progress: "Gantt-compatible tracking"
  quality_gates: "Automated gate enforcement"
  dependencies: "Dependency graph management"
  metrics: "KPI dashboard integration"
  risk_assessment: "Risk matrices"
  resource_allocation: "Team assignments"
```

**When to Scale:**
- Add dependencies when features start interacting
- Add metrics when you need performance tracking
- Add risk assessment for critical features

### 2. Agent Templates (`agents/agent.yaml`)

#### Starting Agent (Basic)
```yaml
basic_agent:
  identity: "Simple role definition"
  commands: "5-10 basic commands"
  workflows: "Core workflows only"
```

#### Evolved Agent (Specialized)
```yaml
specialized_agent:
  identity: "Domain expertise definition"
  commands: "20+ specialized commands"
  workflows: "Domain-specific workflows"
  handoffs: "Context preservation patterns"
  memory: "Learning integration"
  collaboration: "Multi-agent coordination"
```

#### Advanced Agent (Autonomous)
```yaml
autonomous_agent:
  identity: "Self-aware capability model"
  commands: "Dynamic command generation"
  workflows: "Adaptive workflow selection"
  handoffs: "Intelligent context transfer"
  memory: "Pattern extraction and application"
  collaboration: "Swarm coordination"
  self_improvement: "Capability evolution tracking"
  decision_framework: "Autonomous decision trees"
```

**Evolution Triggers:**
- Repeated patterns ‚Üí Extract to commands
- Common workflows ‚Üí Formalize processes
- Cross-agent work ‚Üí Add collaboration
- Pattern detection ‚Üí Enable learning

### 3. Task Templates (`tasks/*.yaml`)

#### Simple Task (1-3 steps)
```yaml
simple_task:
  description: "Single purpose"
  steps: "Linear execution"
  validation: "Basic checks"
```

#### Standard Task (3-10 steps)
```yaml
standard_task:
  description: "Multi-phase execution"
  steps: "Conditional branching"
  validation: "Quality gates"
  rollback: "Error recovery"
  evidence: "Output artifacts"
```

#### Complex Task (10+ steps)
```yaml
complex_task:
  description: "Orchestrated execution"
  steps: "Parallel processing"
  validation: "Multi-tier validation"
  rollback: "Transaction management"
  evidence: "Audit trail"
  monitoring: "Progress tracking"
  optimization: "Performance tuning"
  scaling: "Batch processing"
```

**Scaling Indicators:**
- Repeated failures ‚Üí Add validation
- Long execution ‚Üí Add progress tracking
- Critical operations ‚Üí Add rollback
- High volume ‚Üí Add batch processing

### 4. Workflow Templates (`workflows/*.yaml`)

#### Basic Workflow (Sequential)
```yaml
basic_workflow:
  stages: "3-5 sequential stages"
  decisions: "Simple branching"
  output: "Single deliverable"
```

#### Advanced Workflow (Orchestrated)
```yaml
orchestrated_workflow:
  stages: "10+ parallel/sequential stages"
  decisions: "Complex decision trees"
  output: "Multiple deliverables"
  checkpoints: "Savepoints and recovery"
  metrics: "Performance tracking"
  delegation: "Agent orchestration"
```

#### Enterprise Workflow (Automated)
```yaml
automated_workflow:
  stages: "Dynamic stage generation"
  decisions: "ML-based routing"
  output: "Artifact pipeline"
  checkpoints: "Distributed state management"
  metrics: "Real-time dashboards"
  delegation: "Swarm orchestration"
  optimization: "Self-tuning parameters"
  compliance: "Audit logging"
```

**Evolution Path:**
- Manual steps ‚Üí Automation
- Serial execution ‚Üí Parallelization
- Fixed paths ‚Üí Dynamic routing
- Single agent ‚Üí Multi-agent orchestration

## üéØ Universal Scaling Principles

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with minimal templates
- Add complexity only when needed
- Document why you're scaling

### 2. Scale Triggers
```yaml
scaling_triggers:
  volume: "Same template used >10 times/day"
  complexity: "Steps exceed single screen"
  failures: "Error rate >5%"
  time: "Execution >5 minutes"
  team: "Multiple people using template"
```

### 3. Evolution Process
```yaml
evolution_process:
  1_detect: "Pattern recognition in usage"
  2_extract: "Common patterns to templates"
  3_enhance: "Add intelligence layer"
  4_automate: "Remove manual steps"
  5_distribute: "Enable parallel execution"
```

### 4. Scaling Dimensions

#### Horizontal Scaling (More of the same)
- Multiple instances of templates
- Parallel execution patterns
- Load distribution

#### Vertical Scaling (More capability)
- Enhanced intelligence
- Additional validation
- Richer context

#### Dimensional Scaling (New capabilities)
- Cross-template orchestration
- Meta-template generation
- Self-modification patterns

## üö® Scaling Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Premature Optimization
- Don't add complexity before it's needed
- Don't automate one-time tasks
- Don't over-engineer simple processes

### ‚ùå Template Sprawl
- Don't create new templates for minor variations
- Don't duplicate instead of parameterizing
- Don't abandon old templates without cleanup

### ‚ùå Complexity Creep
- Don't add features without removing others
- Don't nest templates more than 3 levels deep
- Don't create circular dependencies

## üí° Scaling Best Practices

### 1. Measure Before Scaling
```yaml
metrics_to_track:
  usage_frequency: "How often used"
  execution_time: "How long it takes"
  error_rate: "How often it fails"
  modification_rate: "How often changed"
```

### 2. Scale Incrementally
- Add one feature at a time
- Test each scaling step
- Document what changed and why

### 3. Maintain Backwards Compatibility
- New versions should handle old data
- Provide migration paths
- Keep deprecated features temporarily

### 4. Enable Graceful Degradation
- Templates should work with missing features
- Provide fallbacks for advanced features
- Allow disabling of complex features

## üéØ When You Know It's Time to Scale

### Signs Your Templates Need Evolution:
1. **Repetition**: Same modifications made repeatedly
2. **Bottlenecks**: Templates becoming speed limiters
3. **Errors**: Increasing failure rates
4. **Frustration**: Users avoiding templates
5. **Workarounds**: People creating alternatives

### Scaling Success Indicators:
1. **Adoption**: More users choosing templates
2. **Speed**: Faster execution times
3. **Quality**: Fewer errors and rework
4. **Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback
5. **Innovation**: New capabilities emerging

## üöÄ Future-Proofing Your Templates

### Design for Change
- Use variables for volatile values
- Separate configuration from logic
- Build in extension points

### Plan for Growth
- Consider 10x current volume
- Design for distributed execution
- Enable partial execution

### Embrace Evolution
- Templates are living documents
- Encourage experimentation
- Celebrate improvements

**Remember**: Templates should grow with your needs, not ahead of them. Start simple, scale smartly, evolve continuously.
