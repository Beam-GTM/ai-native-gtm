# Integrate Consolidated Knowledge Task
**Type**: Knowledge Management  
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE  
**Created**: 2025-08-28T00:35:00Z  
**Purpose**: Automatically integrate new consolidated knowledge versions into all agents and templates

<!-- 🔴 DIRECTIVE #1 ENFORCEMENT: ALWAYS READ COMPLETE FILES -->
<!-- CRITICAL: This task requires complete file reading for proper integration -->
<!-- This directive OVERRIDES token conservation - read files completely -->

---

## 🎯 TASK PURPOSE

Automatically deploy new consolidated knowledge versions across the entire agent ecosystem, ensuring all agents have access to latest behavioral patterns, detection signs, and mitigation strategies.

rollback_triggers:
  - "Integration test failures"
  - "Agent activation errors after integration"  
  - "Performance degradation >50%"
  - "User-requested rollback"
```

### Rollback Sequence
