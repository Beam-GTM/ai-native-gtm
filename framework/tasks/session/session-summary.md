## Usage Examples

### Automatic Execution
Called automatically by close-chat workflow during session closure.

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Generate session summary
*task session-summary

# With custom timestamp
*task session-summary --date 2025-08-26-14-30
```

### Integration Points
- **close-chat workflow**: Primary consumer
- **orchestrator**: Can trigger manually
- **project-memory**: Source of session data
- **chat-sessions directory**: Output location

## Output Example

```markdown
# Session Summary - 2025-08-26

**Session ID**: chat-2025-08-26-afternoon
**Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes
**Agents Used**: orchestrator, architect, developer
**Workflows**: plan-feature, implement-feature, close-chat

## üéØ Accomplishments
- ‚úÖ Implemented close-chat-workflow feature workspace
- ‚úÖ Created 5-engine orchestrated workflow architecture
- ‚úÖ Generated comprehensive PRD from planning artifacts
- ‚úÖ Established quality gates and validation framework

## üìä Features Worked
- **close-chat-workflow**: 15% complete (planning ‚úÖ, implementation started)
- **memory-learnings-consolidation**: 0% (planned)

## üß† Key Decisions
- Architecture: 5-engine orchestrated pattern based on system-sync
- Performance: Three execution modes (standard/quick/force)
- Error Handling: Phase independence with rollback capability

## üìö Learnings Captured
- Pattern: Orchestrated workflow delegation enables rapid workspace creation
- Learning: Implement-feature workflow works seamlessly with planning artifacts

## üöß Blockers & Issues
- None identified this session

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Session Focus
1. Complete close-chat workflow implementation
2. Create supporting tasks (feature-archival, closure-report)
3. Integrate with orchestrator command routing
4. Test end-to-end execution

## üìà Metrics
- Files Created: 7
- Tasks Completed: 5
- Quality Gates: 1/5 passed
- System Health: GREEN
