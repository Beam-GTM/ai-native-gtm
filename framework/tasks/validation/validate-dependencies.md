# Validate Dependencies Task
**Task ID**: validate-dependencies  
**Priority**: HIGH - Execute at feature completion and milestones  
**Location**: framework/tasks/validation/validate-dependencies.md  
**Category**: validation  
**Complexity**: complex  

## üéØ PURPOSE
Systematically validate all dependencies across the system are current, correct, and properly linked when completing features or milestones. This ensures system integrity and prevents broken references.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE

### **THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:
1. **MANDATORY RULE LOADING** - Load all validation rules before execution
2. **SYSTEMATIC SCANNING** - Check every dependency type in order
3. **EVIDENCE COLLECTION** - Document all issues found
4. **QUALITY GATE INTEGRATION** - Block completion if critical issues exist
5. **REPORT GENERATION** - Create validation report for review

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** Skipping dependency checks or marking features complete with broken dependencies violates quality standards.

    - No broken references
    - All files present
    
  CONCERNS:
    - Minor issues found
    - Non-critical references missing
    - Documentation gaps
    
  FAIL:

  WAIVED:
    - Issues documented
    - Mitigation plan in place
    - User explicitly accepts
```

## üìä METRICS AND THRESHOLDS

### Dependency Health Score
```yaml
scoring:
  100%: All dependencies valid and current
  90-99%: Minor issues, non-blocking
  80-89%: Some issues, needs attention
  <80%: Critical issues, blocks completion

calculation:
  score = (valid_dependencies / total_dependencies) * 100
  
severity_weights:
  CRITICAL: -10% per issue
  HIGH: -5% per issue
  MEDIUM: -2% per issue
  LOW: -1% per issue
```

### Common Issues Patterns
```yaml
patterns:
  missing_dependency_block:  # NEW
    description: File lacks dependency block
    detection: No <!-- dependencies --> block found
    resolution: Add block with extracted dependencies
    
  unidirectional_reference:  # NEW
    description: A references B but B doesn't reference A
    detection: Missing backlink in downstream file
    resolution: Add backlink to maintain bidirectional integrity
    
  stale_references:
    description: Files moved but references not updated
    detection: Path exists check fails
    resolution: Update all references to new path
    
  version_mismatch:
    description: Different versions referenced
    detection: Version comparison fails
    resolution: Standardize to latest version
    
  missing_dependencies:
    description: Required files not present
    detection: File existence check fails
    resolution: Create missing files or update requirements
    
  circular_dependencies:
    description: A depends on B, B depends on A
    detection: Dependency graph has cycles
    resolution: Refactor to break circular reference
    
  orphaned_dependencies:
    description: Referenced but never used
    detection: No incoming references found
    resolution: Remove or document purpose
```

```

## ‚ö° QUICK EXECUTION COMMAND

```bash
# Quick validation for current feature
FEATURE=$(pwd | grep -oP 'features/active/\K[^/]+')
echo "Validating dependencies for: $FEATURE"

# Run validation checks
for category in config agents workflows features rules templates memory links; do
  echo "Checking $category dependencies..."
  # Validation logic here
done

# Generate report
echo "Generating validation report..."
```

## üìù CHECKLIST FOR MANUAL EXECUTION

When manually executing this task:

- [ ] Load this task file completely
- [ ] Read current active context
- [ ] Identify validation scope
- [ ] Load engineering rules
- [ ] Check each dependency category
- [ ] Document all issues found
- [ ] Calculate health score
- [ ] Generate validation report
- [ ] Apply quality gate decision
- [ ] Update feature/milestone status
- [ ] Save report to workspace/data-output/validation-reports/
- [ ] Update active context

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER SKIP** validation for features marked complete
2. **ALWAYS DOCUMENT** issues found, even if waived
3. **BLOCK COMPLETION** if critical dependencies broken
4. **UPDATE IMMEDIATELY** when dependencies change
5. **PRESERVE EVIDENCE** for quality audits

---
**REMEMBER**: Dependency validation ensures system integrity. Never compromise on critical dependencies!
