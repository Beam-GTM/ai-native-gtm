# Create Feature Checklist

**Category**: feature-management
**Complexity**: standard
**Prerequisites**: Feature definition completed, workspace directory exists

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **MANDATORY ENGINEERING RULES LOADING** - Load all required engineering rules before execution
2. **HIERARCHY RESPECT** - Apply top-level rules, then repository-specific overrides  
3. **COMPLIANCE VALIDATION** - All outputs must comply with loaded engineering rules
4. **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION** - Follow step-by-step workflow with user validation
5. **QUALITY GATE INTEGRATION** - Engineering rules compliance checked at each gate

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you skip rule loading or bypass compliance validation, you have violated this workflow.

## Engineering Rules Integration

### Required Engineering Rules
```yaml

## Task Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Engineering Rules Loading & Validation

**Rule Loading Sequence:**

   - Read framework/engineeringrules/core-foundation/file-management.md
   - Parse organization standards
   ```

2. **Context-Based Rule Loading**
   ```yaml
   rule_loading_logic:
     backend_features:
       condition: "feature_type includes 'backend'"
       load: [testing-standards.md, coding-standards.md]
       apply_to: "Backend validation checklist items"
     frontend_features:
       condition: "feature_type includes 'frontend'"

       - load: template-management.md
       - merge_with: top_level_rules  
       - priority: repository_overrides_top_level
   ```

**Engineering Rules Validation** üî¥

Present loaded rules summary to user:
