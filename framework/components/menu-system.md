intent_recognition:
  build_intent:
    triggers: ["build", "create", "make", "start", "new"]
    action: "route_to_feature_creation"
    
  continue_intent:
    triggers: ["continue", "work on", "resume", "keep going"]
    action: "route_to_active_feature"
    
  help_intent:
    triggers: ["help", "explain", "how", "what", "guide"]

```yaml
routing_intelligence:
  context_aware: true
  fuzzy_matching: 85%
  learning_enabled: true
  
  route_patterns:
    numbered_selection: "1-6 maps to menu options"
    go_command: "executes suggested action"
    natural_language: "analyzes intent and suggests best action"
    shorthand: "common abbreviations work (e.g., 'dev' for developer)"
```

## Implementation Protocol

1. **State Detection**: Analyze system state (template/critical/active/clean)
2. **Menu Selection**: Choose appropriate menu template
3. **Dynamic Population**: Fill placeholders with real data
4. **Smart Suggestions**: Calculate optimal "GO" action
5. **Contextual Tips**: Generate relevant lightbulb tips
6. **Display**: Present formatted menu
7. **Input Processing**: Handle user selection intelligently

## Response Templates

### Confirmation Pattern
```
✅ Great choice! {ACTION_DESCRIPTION}

{CONTEXT_TRANSFER_INFO}

Ready to proceed? (Y/n)
```

### Suggestion Pattern  
```
🎯 I see you want to {INTERPRETED_INTENT}. 

Should I {SUGGESTED_ACTION}? This will help you:
• {BENEFIT_1}
• {BENEFIT_2}
• {BENEFIT_3}

Launch {AGENT/WORKFLOW}? (Y/n)
```

### Error Recovery Pattern
```
🤔 I didn't quite understand "{USER_INPUT}". 

💡 Did you mean:
1. {SUGGESTION_1}
2. {SUGGESTION_2}
3. {SUGGESTION_3}

Or just tell me what you'd like to accomplish!
```
