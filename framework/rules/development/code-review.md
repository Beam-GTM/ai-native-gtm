# Code Review Standards

## üîç **CODE REVIEW STANDARDS**

### **Review Checklist**
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Tests cover critical functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No hardcoded values or secrets
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Code is DRY but not over-abstracted

### **Review Process**
1. **Functional Review**: Does it work as intended?
2. **Quality Review**: Is it maintainable and readable?
3. **Security Review**: Are there vulnerabilities?
4. **Performance Review**: Are there bottlenecks?
5. **Test Review**: Are tests comprehensive?

### **Code Improvements During Review**

#### **Improve Error Messages:**
```python
# Bad
if not user_id:
    raise ValueError("Invalid input")

# Good
if not user_id:
    raise ValueError(f"User ID is required but got: {user_id}")
```

#### **Refactor Large Functions:**
```python
# Bad - Large function doing multiple things
def process_order(order_data):
    # 100 lines of validation, calculation, and saving
    pass

# Good - Single-purpose functions
def validate_order(order_data):
    """Validate order data structure and content."""
    pass

def calculate_order_total(order_items):
    """Calculate total price including tax and discounts."""
    pass

def save_order(validated_order):
    """Persist order to database."""
    pass
```
