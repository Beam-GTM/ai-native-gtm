# Quality Assurance Standards

## âœ… **QUALITY ASSURANCE**

### **Engineering Excellence Standards**
- **Understand First**: Ensure full understanding before action
- **Plan & Design**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, well-documented code
- **Testing**: Assume code needs to be testable
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve existing code
- **Security**: Be mindful of security best practices
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications
- **Tool Usage**: Leverage available tools effectively

### **General Engineering Principles**
- Follow SOLID principles but evaluate case-by-case
- Don't over-fixate on DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- Prioritize clarity unless performance is critical
- Write code with testability in mind
- Avoid introducing vulnerabilities
- Continuously look for improvement opportunities
