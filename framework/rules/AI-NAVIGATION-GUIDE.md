# AI Navigation Guide for Engineering Rules

## üéØ **NAVIGATION STRATEGY FOR AI AGENTS**

### **Primary Access Pattern: Task-Based Loading**

When an AI agent needs engineering rules, follow this decision tree:

```yaml
NAVIGATION_DECISION_TREE:
  1_identify_task:
    question: "What task am I performing?"
    examples:
      - "Writing a PRD" ‚Üí Load product-management/prd-writing.md
      - "Reviewing code" ‚Üí Load development/code-review.md
      - "Organizing files" ‚Üí Load core-foundation/file-management.md
      - "Running tests" ‚Üí Load development/testing-standards.md
      - "Updating system" ‚Üí Load system-operations/system-update-protocol.md

  2_check_index:
    action: "If unsure, load INDEX.md first"
    benefit: "Quick overview of all available rules"
    path: "engineeringrules/INDEX.md"

  3_lazy_loading:
    principle: "Load only what you need, when you need it"
    not: "Don't load all 37 files at once"
    instead: "Load specific sections for specific tasks"
```

## üìã **COMMON AI SCENARIOS & NAVIGATION**

### **Scenario 1: Agent Activation**
```yaml
when: "AI agent is activating/initializing"
load:
  - core-foundation/placement-standards.md  # For file organization rules
  - core-foundation/memory-system.md        # For memory requirements
why: "These define core operational standards"
```

### **Scenario 2: Development Task**
```yaml
when: "AI is writing or reviewing code"
load_sequence:
  1: development/coding-standards.md        # General standards
  2: development/python-standards.md        # If Python project
  3: development/testing-standards.md       # If writing tests
  4: development/llm-development.md         # If LLM features
optional:
  - development/code-review.md              # For PR reviews
  - development/linting-formatting.md       # For code cleanup
```

### **Scenario 3: Product Management**
```yaml
when: "AI is doing product work"
for_prd_creation:
  - product-management/prd-writing.md       # PRD format & structure
for_sprint_planning:
  - product-management/agile-sprint.md      # Sprint standards
  - product-management/backlog-management.md # Backlog organization
for_releases:
  - product-management/release-management.md # Release process
```

### **Scenario 4: System Operations**
```yaml
when: "AI is managing system operations"
for_generation:
  - system-operations/system-generation.md  # Generation standards
  - system-operations/template-management.md # Template rules
for_maintenance:
  - system-operations/file-operations.md    # File management
  - system-operations/system-update-protocol.md # Update procedures
for_emergency:
  - system-operations/emergency-procedures.md # Recovery protocols
```

## üîç **SEARCH STRATEGIES**

### **Strategy 1: Grep Across Shards**
```bash
# Search for a specific concept across all shards
grep -r "validation" engineeringrules/*/

# Search within a specific domain
grep -r "test" engineeringrules/development/

# Find specific standards
grep -r "CRITICAL_RULE" engineeringrules/
```

### **Strategy 2: Smart Context Loading**
```yaml
intelligent_loading:
  step_1: "Identify the domain first"
    - Is it development? ‚Üí development/
    - Is it product? ‚Üí product-management/
    - Is it operations? ‚Üí system-operations/
    - Is it foundational? ‚Üí core-foundation/
  
  step_2: "Load domain index pattern"
    example: "Load all development/*.md for coding session"
  
  step_3: "Cache for session"
    principle: "Keep loaded rules in context for session duration"
```

## üöÄ **OPTIMIZED LOADING PATTERNS**

### **Pattern 1: Progressive Loading**
```yaml
progressive_pattern:
  initial: Load INDEX.md for overview
  focused: Load specific shard for task
  expanded: Load related shards if needed
  complete: Load full domain only if comprehensive work

example_flow:
  1: AI needs to write tests
  2: Load INDEX.md, see testing-standards.md exists
  3: Load development/testing-standards.md
  4: Task requires Python specifics
  5: Also load development/python-standards.md
  6: Don't load unrelated shards
```

### **Pattern 2: Domain Bundle Loading**
```yaml
domain_bundles:
  development_bundle:
    core: [coding-standards.md, python-standards.md]
    testing: [testing-standards.md, quality-metrics.md]
    review: [code-review.md, linting-formatting.md]
  
  product_bundle:
    planning: [prd-writing.md, agile-sprint.md]
    execution: [backlog-management.md, metrics-reporting.md]
    delivery: [release-management.md, product-quality.md]
  
  operations_bundle:
    generation: [system-generation.md, template-management.md]
    maintenance: [file-operations.md, system-update-protocol.md]
    health: [architecture-operations.md, performance-optimization.md]
```

## üìä **CONTEXT MANAGEMENT FOR AI**

### **Working Memory Strategy**
```yaml
context_limits:
  problem: "AI has limited context window"
  solution: "Strategic loading and unloading"

management_approach:
  1_task_start:
    - Load relevant shards for immediate task
    - Keep in context during task execution
  
  2_task_switch:
    - Summarize key rules from previous task
    - Unload detailed rules
    - Load new task-specific rules
  
  3_reference_needed:
    - Temporarily load specific shard
    - Extract needed information
    - Unload after use
```

### **Caching Strategy**
```yaml
cache_hierarchy:
  session_cache:
    - INDEX.md (always available)
    - Current domain shards
    - Recently accessed rules
  
  task_cache:
    - Active task rules
    - Related standards
    - Quality gates
  
  reference_cache:
    - Quick reference snippets
    - Common patterns
    - Critical rules only
```

## üéØ **QUICK REFERENCE MAPPING**

### **Task ‚Üí Rule Mapping**
```yaml
quick_map:
  "need to organize files": core-foundation/file-management.md
  "writing documentation": core-foundation/documentation-standards.md
  "designing system": core-foundation/system-design-principles.md
  "managing memory": core-foundation/memory-system.md
  
  "writing Python code": development/python-standards.md
  "creating tests": development/testing-standards.md
  "reviewing PR": development/code-review.md
  "building LLM feature": development/llm-development.md
  
  "creating PRD": product-management/prd-writing.md
  "planning sprint": product-management/agile-sprint.md
  "managing backlog": product-management/backlog-management.md
  "preparing release": product-management/release-management.md
  
  "generating system": system-operations/system-generation.md
  "managing templates": system-operations/template-management.md
  "updating system": system-operations/system-update-protocol.md
  "handling emergency": system-operations/emergency-procedures.md
```

## üí° **BEST PRACTICES FOR AI NAVIGATION**

### **DO's**
```yaml
best_practices:
  - DO use INDEX.md as starting point when unsure
  - DO load specific shards for specific tasks
  - DO cache frequently used rules for session
  - DO unload rules when switching contexts
  - DO use search to find specific concepts
  - DO load related shards together (e.g., testing + python)
```

### **DON'Ts**
```yaml
avoid:
  - DON'T load all 37 shards at once
  - DON'T keep unrelated rules in context
  - DON'T reload unchanged rules repeatedly
  - DON'T ignore the INDEX.md navigation
  - DON'T load consolidated files when shards exist
```

## üîÑ **INTEGRATION WITH AI WORKFLOWS**

### **Orchestrator Integration**
```yaml
orchestrator_commands:
  "*rules [domain]": Load all rules for domain
  "*rule [specific]": Load specific rule shard
  "*rules-index": Load INDEX.md for navigation
  "*rules-search [term]": Search across all shards

examples:
  "*rules development": Loads all development/*.md
  "*rule prd-writing": Loads product-management/prd-writing.md
  "*rules-search validation": Searches for validation rules
```

### **Agent Activation Pattern**
```yaml
agent_activation:
  1_on_activation:
    - Agent reads its own definition
    - Agent checks INDEX.md for relevant rules
    - Agent loads domain-specific shards
  
  2_during_operation:
    - Agent loads task-specific rules on demand
    - Agent caches rules for session duration
    - Agent unloads when switching tasks
  
  3_on_handoff:
    - Agent summarizes applicable rules
    - Agent indicates which shards next agent needs
    - Agent clears task-specific rule cache
```

## üìö **FALLBACK STRATEGIES**

### **When Unsure Which Shard**
```yaml
fallback_sequence:
  1: Load INDEX.md
  2: Search for keywords in index
  3: Load 2-3 most likely shards
  4: Search within loaded shards
  5: Expand search if not found
```

### **When Need Comprehensive View**
```yaml
comprehensive_loading:
  option_1: "Load all shards in domain"
    example: "Load all development/*.md for code audit"
  
  option_2: "Load original consolidated file"
    example: "Load development-standards.md for full picture"
  
  option_3: "Load INDEX.md + specific sections"
    example: "Use index to navigate + load key sections"
```
