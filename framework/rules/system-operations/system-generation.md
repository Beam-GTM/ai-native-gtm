# System Generation Standards

## ðŸš€ **SYSTEM GENERATION STANDARDS**

### **Generation Quality Principles**

#### **Quality Preservation Mandate**
```yaml
CRITICAL_RULE: Generated systems MUST maintain or enhance Nexus quality
  - NO quality degradation permitted during generation
  - Architect-grade standards preserved in all systems
  - Domain specialization enhances (not replaces) sophistication
  - Self-reference architecture must be fully functional
```

#### **Architectural Integrity**
```yaml
CRITICAL_RULE: Generated systems MUST preserve architectural patterns
  - 8-agent sophisticated orchestration mandatory
  - Two-tier context management (foundation + feature) preserved
  - Quality gates with engineering rule compliance maintained
  - Memory management with state preservation functional
  - Command interface with fuzzy matching (85% confidence) operational
```

#### **Domain Specialization Excellence**
```yaml
CRITICAL_RULE: Domain specialization MUST add value without compromising foundation
  - Agent personas specialized while preserving collaboration
  - Workflows adapted while maintaining orchestration
  - Context templates relevant while preserving management
  - Quality standards enhanced while maintaining validation
```

### **Agent Generation Standards**

#### **Agent Specialization Requirements**
```yaml
mandatory_preservation:
  - Agent collaboration patterns and handoff protocols
  - Context awareness and memory integration capabilities
  - Quality gate participation and validation responsibilities
  - Command interface integration and response patterns
  - State preservation during agent transitions

required_adaptations:
  - Persona definitions specialized for domain expertise
  - Domain-specific knowledge base and best practices
  - Domain workflow patterns and process optimization
  - Domain quality standards and validation criteria
  - Domain-specific tool and technology integration
```

#### **Agent Quality Validation**
```yaml
validation_criteria:
  - Agent persona demonstrates clear domain expertise
  - Agent collaboration patterns preserve sophistication
  - Agent context integration functional with workflows
  - Agent quality participation enhanced for requirements
  - Agent command interface responsive with context

evidence_required:
  - Agent configuration testing with workflow simulation
  - Collaboration pattern validation with coordination
  - Context integration testing with memory patterns
```

### **Workflow Generation Standards**

#### **Workflow Adaptation Requirements**
```yaml
mandatory_preservation:
  - Multi-agent coordination with systematic orchestration
  - Quality checkpoint integration with validation frameworks
  - Context loading and memory update triggers
  - Progress tracking with comprehensive state management
  - Error handling and graceful degradation patterns

required_adaptations:
  - Workflow steps specialized for process efficiency
  - Domain-specific quality criteria and validation
  - Domain workflow integration with external systems
  - Domain-specific deliverable formats and criteria
  - Domain compliance and regulatory integration
```

### **Context Generation Standards**

#### **Context Architecture Requirements**
```yaml
mandatory_preservation:
  - Two-tier architecture with automatic detection
  - Memory update triggers with state management
  - Context validation preventing broken references
  - Cross-agent context sharing with preservation
  - Structured memory updates based on events

required_adaptations:
  - Foundation context templates for domain
  - Feature context patterns optimized for workflows
  - Domain-specific memory tracking patterns
  - Domain context validation rules
  - Domain integration context for systems
```

### **Quality Framework Generation**

#### **Engineering Rules Enhancement**
```yaml
mandatory_preservation:
  - Context access patterns with governance
  - Memory management rules with consistency
  - Quality validation frameworks with evidence
  - Rule compliance systems with enforcement
  - Engineering documentation with coverage

required_adaptations:
  - Domain-specific quality standards
  - Domain regulatory and industry integration
  - Domain-specific validation patterns
  - Domain engineering best practices
  - Domain-specific tool standards
```

### **Deployment Readiness Standards**

#### **System Integration Requirements**
```yaml
mandatory_testing:
  - End-to-end system functional with workflow execution
  - Agent switching operational with context preservation
  - Quality gates functional at validation checkpoints
  - Memory management operational with tracking
  - Command interface responsive with integration

domain_testing:
  - Domain workflows executable with systems
  - Domain context management functional
  - Domain quality standards operational
  - Domain documentation accessible
  - Domain system scalable for usage
```

### **Self-Reference Architecture**

#### **Recursive Generation Capability**
```yaml
mandatory_requirements:
  - Generated system can generate other systems
  - Template system functional for sub-generation
  - Quality inheritance operational for systems
  - Domain expertise propagates to sub-systems
  - Architectural integrity maintained across levels

validation_requirements:
