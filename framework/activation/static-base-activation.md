# Static Base Activation Sequence

## 🔴 MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL 🔴
**THIS SEQUENCE MUST BE EXECUTED FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS**
**ALL STEPS MUST COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE ANY DYNAMIC ACTIVATION**

## Purpose
This file contains the STATIC activation steps (1-6) that are safe to centralize across all agents. These steps perform basic file loading without conditional logic or system state modification.

**CRITICAL**: This file contains ONLY static loading operations. All dynamic execution, conditional logic, and agent-specific behaviors remain in individual agent files.

**EXECUTION GUARANTEE**: Every step must complete successfully. If any step fails, report the failure and continue with available context, but mark the activation as incomplete.

## Static Activation Steps (1-6) - MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: TIMESTAMP LOADING
Execute `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` to load current timestamp for documentation updates

### STEP 2: CRITICAL DIRECTIVES LOADING  
Load framework/CRITICAL-DIRECTIVES.md ALWAYS - mandatory compliance directives

### STEP 3: PROJECT MEMORY LOADING
Load workspace/memory/project-memory.md ALWAYS - single source of truth for ALL sessions

### STEP 3.5: BEHAVIORAL INTELLIGENCE LOADING ⚡ ALWAYS CURRENT  
Load workspace/memory/consolidated/ACTIVE-BEHAVIORAL-INTELLIGENCE.md ALWAYS - current behavioral intelligence with auto-updates
**PURPOSE**: Always-current knowledge base - auto-updated with latest behavioral patterns, detection signs, and mitigation strategies
**GUARANTEE**: This file is automatically maintained to reflect the latest consolidated knowledge version

### STEP 4: MEMORY VALIDATION
Verify memory bank health and active context currency (<5 min old)

### STEP 5: RAPID FOUNDATION LOADING ⚡ OPTIMIZED INDEXES
Execute ALL foundation files in SINGLE parallel tool call batch:
- operations/index.md (optimized registry - 20 lines vs 75)
- operations/agents/index.md (optimized agents - 25 lines vs 135)
- framework/index.md (optimized framework - 25 lines vs 35)
- workspace/features/index.md (optimized features - 30 lines vs 525)
- SYSTEM-STRUCTURE.md (complete system map)
- briefing/system-architecture.md (system design)
- workspace/memory/consolidated/ACTIVE-BEHAVIORAL-INTELLIGENCE.md (always-current behavioral intelligence)
- framework/components/menu-system.md (centralized menu display system)

### STEP 5.5: BEHAVIORAL PATTERN REGISTRY LOADING ⚡ REFERENCE-BASED ARCHITECTURE
Load behavioral pattern registry for session-wide correction (Mental Model Framework):
- framework/behavioral-patterns/behavioral-patterns-registry.yaml (Central pattern registry)
**PATTERN ACTIVATION**: {{load_behavioral_patterns: critical_patterns}} (75% failure prevention)
**PATTERNS LOADED**: execution_documentation_paradox (35%), false_completion_syndrome (19%), basic_operations_failure (21%)
**PURPOSE**: Reference-based behavioral pattern correction with clean architecture
**ACTIVATION**: Patterns loaded by reference and active throughout session

### STEP 5.7: DATABASE TRUTH LOADING ⚡ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
Load centralized truth database for accurate system counts (Zero-Setup Guarantee):
- Execute: `source framework/activation/load-truth.sh` OR `python3 framework/activation/truth-loader.py`
- **AUTO-CREATION**: Database creates itself if missing (zero user setup required)
- **FALLBACK**: Gracefully degrades to INDEX.md parsing if database unavailable
- **PURPOSE**: Single source of truth for all feature/component counts
- **GUARANTEE**: Always returns counts (database preferred, file fallback)
- **EXPORT**: Sets ACTIVE_FEATURES, COMPLETED_FEATURES, TOTAL_FEATURES environment variables

### STEP 6: MANDATORY VALIDATION CHECKPOINT ⚡ OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE
**EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**
- Count total files attempted vs successfully loaded (optimized indexes + behavioral pattern registry)
- Report "STATIC ACTIVATION: X/Y optimized index files + behavioral pattern registry loaded successfully"
- **REQUIREMENT**: Must load at minimum 7/9 optimized foundation files + behavioral pattern registry to proceed
- **PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT**: ~755 lines reduced to ~100 lines (87% reduction in context overhead)
- **BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENT**: Registry must be loaded with critical_patterns activated (91% failure prevention)
- If < minimum files loaded: Report specific missing files and continue with degraded context
- **CRITICAL**: Mark activation status (COMPLETE/DEGRADED/FAILED) for handoff to dynamic activation
- **BEHAVIORAL STATUS**: Report pattern registry status and active pattern set for session monitoring

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- ✅ Timestamp loaded and available
- ✅ Critical directives loaded for compliance
- ✅ Project memory loaded for session continuity  
- ✅ Behavioral intelligence loaded for real-time pattern recognition (always current version)
- ✅ Memory validation completed
- ✅ Foundation files loaded (minimum 6/8 required)
- ✅ **Behavioral pattern registry loaded (reference-based architecture)**
- ✅ **Mental model framework active (91% failure pattern coverage via registry)**
- ✅ Validation checkpoint passed with pattern registry active

**BEFORE PROCEEDING TO DYNAMIC ACTIVATION:**
- Static activation status must be reported
- All critical files (steps 1-4) must be loaded
- Agent must acknowledge static loading completion
- Agent must be ready to execute dynamic behaviors

## Integration Notes

### For Agents Using This File
```yaml
# ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP - STATIC ACTIVATION MUST BE EXECUTED BEFORE ANY DYNAMIC STEPS
activation-instructions:
  # STEP 0: STATIC BASE ACTIVATION (MANDATORY FIRST)
  - "🔴 EXECUTE FIRST: framework/activation/static-base-activation.md"
  - "🔴 WAIT FOR: Static activation completion confirmation before proceeding"
  - "🔴 VERIFY: All critical files loaded (steps 1-4 minimum)"
  
  # ONLY AFTER STATIC ACTIVATION COMPLETE:
  # Continue with your agent-specific dynamic steps 7-19+
  - "STEP 7: [Agent-specific dynamic behaviors - ONLY after static completion]"
  - "STEP 8+: [Conditional execution, persona adoption, etc.]"
```

### EXECUTION ORDER ENFORCEMENT
**RULE**: Static activation ALWAYS precedes dynamic activation
**VALIDATION**: Agent must confirm static activation completion
**HANDOFF**: Static activation status reported to dynamic phase
**REQUIREMENT**: No dynamic steps until static validation checkpoint passed

### What This File Does NOT Include
- **Conditional execution** (like auto-consolidation checks)
- **Agent-specific persona adoption**
- **Dynamic menu generation**
- **System state modification**
- **Behavioral pattern establishment**
- **Complex decision-making logic**

All dynamic behaviors remain in individual agents to preserve functionality.

## Performance Benefits
- Centralized static loading enables optimization
- Parallel file loading in Step 5 improves speed
- Consistent loading sequence across all agents
- Reduced duplication of basic loading operations

## Maintenance Benefits  
- Single point of update for basic loading operations
- Consistent timestamp and memory loading across system
- Centralized foundation file loading management
- Simplified debugging of basic loading issues
