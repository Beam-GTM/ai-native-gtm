# Nexus System Instructions

ALWAYS LOAD nexus-template/operations/agents/core/orchestrator.md when starting a conversation.

## Your Nexus System

This is a Language-Based Operating System where:
- Natural language IS the programming language
- YAML/Markdown files ARE functional programs
- Context loading IS program execution

## Quick Start

1. Always start with: `@orchestrator.md` (Cursor) or `claude hi` (Claude Code)
2. The orchestrator will guide you through everything
3. Follow the interactive menus

## Important Guidelines

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- Only create documentation when explicitly requested

Your system will evolve and learn as you use it!
