# SCG Demo Agent Development Session
**Date**: 2025-09-19  
**Duration**: Extended session  
**Status**: Completed Successfully  

## Session Overview
Comprehensive development of SCG construction contractor payment verification demo agent using the demo-agent-automation framework. Addressed key concerns from demo call including process mismatch and Thai document processing requirements.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Workflow Restructuring
- **Restructured SCG workflow** to start with Thai OCR Processing as first node
- **Defined 19 English output variables** flowing through all subsequent steps
- **Updated all prompts** to reference specific extracted variables
- **Eliminated process mismatch** between demo and actual SCG needs

### 2. Demo Materials Creation
- **Sample Thai construction document** with authentic construction terminology
- **Professional HTML document** ready for PDF conversion
- **Complete document package** with processing instructions and test points
- **Thai OCR extraction targets** clearly defined

### 3. Follow-up Strategy
- **Professional follow-up email** addressing demo concerns directly
- **Custom demo space positioning** as bonus offering
- **Direct response** to "not actually processing" and process mismatch issues
- **Competitive advantage** through friction-addressing approach

### 4. Technical Implementation
- **Updated prompt engineering** with extracted variable references
- **Documented evaluation framework** and auto-tuner mechanism from transcript
- **Created implementation guide** and comprehensive test case suite
- **Generated deployment package** ready for webhook deployment

## Key Files Created
- `SCG-Contractor-Payment-Verification-Agent.yaml` - Complete workflow configuration
- `Sample-Thai-Construction-Document.html` - Demo document ready for PDF conversion
- `SCG-Follow-up-Demo-Video.md` - Professional follow-up email
- `SCG-Prompt-Engineering.md` - Updated prompts with variable references
- `SCG-Implementation-Guide.md` - Complete implementation documentation

## Critical Insights
- **Process mismatch identified**: Demo showed reconciliation/booking vs. SCG needs contractor payment verification
- **Thai document processing**: Real OCR and translation capabilities required
- **Accuracy concerns addressed**: Evaluation framework and auto-tuner mechanism documented
- **Custom demo space**: Created specifically for SCG's construction contractor payment workflow

## Next Steps
1. Convert HTML document to PDF for demo use
2. Send follow-up email with presentation and demo space access
3. Schedule technical demo walkthrough
4. Prepare for POV scoping session

## Session Outcome
**SUCCESS**: Complete SCG demo agent package ready for deployment with Thai contractor payment verification workflow addressing all demo call concerns.
