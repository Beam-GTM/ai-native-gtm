**Generated**: 2025-09-17T18:05:00Z
**Session Type**: Feature Planning Session
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Workflow**: plan-feature (transcript-processing-automation)

## Session Overview
Successful feature planning session for transcript-processing-automation component within Personal Sales GTM Operating System for Beam AI.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Feature Definition Completed
- **Feature Name**: transcript-processing-automation
- **Problem**: Manual follow-up creation from call transcripts is time-consuming and inconsistent
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Reduce post-call follow-up time from 15-20 minutes to 2-3 minutes
  - Generate follow-ups within 24 hours of call completion
  - Achieve 90%+ satisfaction rate on AI-generated follow-up quality

### 2. Interactive Elicitation Session
- **Key Discovery**: New company trigger as primary workflow initiator
- **Simplification**: User chose simple company-level folder structure over complex deal-based hierarchy
- **Structure Validated**: Companies/{company-name}/transcripts/emails/documents/
- **Proof of Concept**: Successfully created ICS folder structure

### 3. ULTRATHINK Analysis Applied
- Analyzed file storage vs data relationship patterns
- Recommended HubSpot-first architecture but user chose simplicity
- Validated company-centric organization pattern as user preference

### 4. Workflow Creation
- **Created**: create-company-structure-workflow.md
- **Applied**: Complete workflow template with quality gates
- **Integration**: Designed handoff to transcript processing automation

## Artifacts Generated
- `feature-definition.yaml` - Complete feature specification
- `elicitation-insights.yaml` - Discovery session insights and patterns
- `create-company-structure-workflow.md` - Automated company folder creation workflow

## Planning Progress
- ✅ Step 1: Feature Definition (Completed)
- ✅ Step 2: Interactive Elicitation Session (Completed)
- ⏸️ Step 3: Technical Planning (Ready for next session)
- ⏸️ Step 4: Resource Planning (Pending)
- ⏸️ Step 5: ULTRATHINK Validation (Pending)

## Session Context Applied
- **Beam AI Sales Context**: Successfully applied personal sales automation focus
- **ICP Understanding**: Finance, BFSI, BPO companies with 150+ employees
- **Technology Integration**: HubSpot, Slack, Gmail, Notion integration points identified

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Scope**: Simple processing flow (Option A) over complex intelligence
2. **Organization**: Company-level folders over deal-level hierarchy
