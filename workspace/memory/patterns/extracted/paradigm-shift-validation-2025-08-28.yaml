# Application Guide

## When to Apply This Pattern
1. User expresses frustration with recurring system violations
2. Prevention approaches have failed repeatedly (0-5% feasible)
3. User suggests alternative approach ("what if we...")
4. System needs reliability improvement

## How to Apply
1. **Listen for User Insights**: User frustration often contains solution seeds
2. **Reframe the Problem**: Move from "how to prevent" to "how to detect + correct"  
3. **Prototype Immediately**: Build proof-of-concept to validate paradigm shift
4. **Gather Evidence**: Use concrete metrics to prove feasibility jump
5. **Implement Comprehensively**: Build production-ready system if validated

## Success Indicators
- Feasibility jumps from 0-10% to 70%+ 
- User insight directly enables the breakthrough
- Evidence-based validation proves the approach
- Production deployment demonstrates reliability

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Ignoring user frustration as "just complaining"
- Persisting with failed prevention approaches
- Building theoretical solutions without evidence
- Skipping prototype validation phase

---
**REMEMBER**: The most breakthrough solutions often come from user insights that completely reframe impossible problems into feasible detection + correction approaches!
