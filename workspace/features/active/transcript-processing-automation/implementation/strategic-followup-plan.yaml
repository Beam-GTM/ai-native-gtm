## CHANNEL 2: DIRECT CALL TO DORIAN (PROCUREMENT CHAMPION)
### Purpose: Relationship building + competitive positioning

call_strategy:
  timing: "Within 24 hours of email send"

  conversation_framework:
    opening_approach: |
      "Hi Dorian, thanks for facilitating such a thorough evaluation session yesterday. 
      I wanted to follow up briefly on the RFI process and see if you had any additional 
      questions after reviewing our detailed response email."
      
    key_messages:
      competitive_differentiation: |
        "I know you're evaluating multiple suppliers this week. What I'd highlight

# COMPETITIVE POSITIONING STRATEGY

against_todays_competitors:
  our_advantage: "First to present = first to address friction points"
  positioning_messages:
    proactive_problem_solving: |
      "While other vendors may present impressive capabilities, we've already begun 
      addressing the specific implementation challenges your team identified."
      
    financial_services_focus: |
      "Our experience with German financial institutions demonstrates proven capability 
      in your regulatory environment, not just general AI capabilities."
      
    implementation_partnership: |
      "We're not just selling software - we're offering a dedicated implementation 
      partnership with ongoing support through your transformation."
      
  risk_mitigation:
    if_competitors_address_same_concerns: |
      • Emphasize our "proactive response" vs "reactive addressing"
      • Highlight specific financial services experience vs general capabilities
      • Focus on implementation partnership vs product-only approach

# TIMING COORDINATION

execution_timeline:
  hour_0_6: "Send comprehensive friction-addressing email to full team"
  hour_12_18: "Follow-up call with Dorian (procurement lead)"
  hour_24_36: "Technical follow-up email to Manuel with call offer"
  hour_48_72: "Brief check-in with Jessica (business developer) on evaluation process"
  
  critical_window: |
    Must complete all outreach before competitors finish presenting (48 hours max)
    Goal: Establish preferred supplier position before final evaluation phase

# SUCCESS METRICS

immediate_indicators:
  - "Email acknowledged within 24 hours"
  - "Dorian call completed with positive reception"
  - "Manuel requests technical validation session"
  - "Additional questions or document requests from team"
  
medium_term_signals:
  - "Technical concerns addressed to Manuel's satisfaction"
  - "Commercial terms discussion with Dorian"
  - "Request for implementation timeline or next steps"
  - "Introduction to additional stakeholders not in original meeting"
  
win_indicators:

  - "Commercial negotiation invitation"
  - "POV scoping session scheduled"
  - "Exclusivity period granted for final evaluation"

# RISK MITIGATION

potential_risks:
  competitor_copycat: |
    Risk: Competitors address same friction points in their presentations
    Mitigation: Emphasize our proactive identification and response speed
    
  over_communication: |
    Risk: Appearing desperate or pushy with multiple touchpoints
    Mitigation: Professional, value-focused communication with clear business purpose
    
  technical_complexity: |
    Risk: Manuel's technical requirements too complex for our capabilities
    Mitigation: Honest technical validation call to confirm feasibility early
    
  procurement_process: |
    Risk: Dorian required to maintain vendor neutrality
    Mitigation: Focus on process facilitation and evaluation support, not sales pressure

# RECOMMENDED EXECUTION APPROACH

primary_strategy: "Professional competence + proactive problem solving"

key_success_factors:
  1. "Speed of response (before competitors present)"
  2. "Quality of friction point addressing"
  3. "Champion relationship development with Dorian + Manuel"
  4. "Professional tone avoiding sales pressure"
  5. "Concrete evidence for all claims (case studies, documentation)"

competitive_differentiation: |
  "We identified and addressed your specific concerns BEFORE the competition even presented. 
  This demonstrates the proactive partnership approach you can expect throughout implementation."
