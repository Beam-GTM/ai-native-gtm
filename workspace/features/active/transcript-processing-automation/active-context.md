## üéØ CURRENT WORK FOCUS

### Active Phase
**Phase 1: Core Processing** (Weeks 1-3)  
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 1.1 - Transcript Processor Component  
**Week**: 1 of 9 total implementation weeks

### Today's Priority
**Immediate Focus**: Begin transcript processor development using ICS data as test case  
**Next Milestone**: Process ICS transcript and identify all 6 participants  
**Success Criteria**: Entity extraction working with real business data

## üìã FEATURE OVERVIEW

### What We're Building
**Intelligent Sales Transcript Processing System** that automates follow-up generation from meeting recordings.

### Real-World Context
- **Test Case**: ICS RFI presentation transcript (900 lines)
- **Participants**: 6 distinct roles (technical, commercial, operational)
- **Business Context**: Competitive RFI with 12 use cases to address
- **Value**: Reduce 2-hour manual follow-up to 15-minute automated process

### Core Components (4-part pipeline)
1. **Transcript Processor**: Extract participants, roles, business context
2. **Intelligence Synthesizer**: Generate business insights and competitive analysis
3. **Follow-up Generator**: Create personalized emails for each participant role
4. **CRM Integration**: Automate HubSpot updates and activity logging

## üîÑ SESSION CONTINUITY

### Context From Previous Sessions
- ‚úÖ **Planning Phase Completed**: Comprehensive planning using real ICS transcript
- ‚úÖ **Technical Architecture**: 4-component pipeline designed with real business validation
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Workspace**: Complete PRD, progress tracking, quality gates created
- üîÑ **Current Phase**: Implementation Phase 1 - Core Processing

### Key Decisions Made
- **Company-Centric Organization**: Use Companies/{name}/ folder structure
- **Real-Data Validation**: ICS transcript as primary test case throughout development
- **Role-Based Personalization**: Different follow-up approaches for technical vs commercial participants

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

### Implementation Progress
- **Overall**: 15% (Planning complete, workspace ready)
- **Phase 1**: 25% (Workspace setup, ready for development)
- **Current Sprint**: 0% (Just starting Sprint 1.1)

### Immediate Tasks (This Week)
1. **Setup Development Environment**: APIs, test data, tooling
2. **Begin Transcript Processor**: Entity extraction algorithm
3. **Test with ICS Data**: Validate participant identification
4. **Folder Automation**: Auto-create Companies/ICS/ structure

### Next Sprint Goals (Week 2)
1. **Complete Entity Extraction**: All 6 ICS participants identified
2. **Role Classification**: Technical vs commercial vs operational
3. **Business Context Detection**: RFI/competitive situation recognition

## üéØ WORK PATTERNS

### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven with Real Data**: Use ICS transcript for all validation
- **Component-First**: Build and test each component individually
- **Incremental Integration**: Connect components as they're completed
- **Quality-First**: Validate against quality gates at each phase

### Validation Strategy
- **Real-World Testing**: Every feature tested with actual business data
- **Role-Based Validation**: Ensure outputs appropriate for each participant type
- **Business Context Validation**: Competitive intelligence and positioning accuracy
- **User Acceptance**: Sales team review and approval of generated outputs

## üîó KEY RELATIONSHIPS

### Data Flow
```
ICS Transcript (900 lines) ‚Üí
Transcript Processor (extract 6 participants) ‚Üí
Intelligence Synthesizer (12 use cases + competitive context) ‚Üí
Follow-up Generator (6 personalized emails) ‚Üí
CRM Integration (HubSpot updates)
```

### File Organization
```
Companies/ICS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcripts/RFI-Presentation-Workshop.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ emails/outbound/ (6 personalized follow-ups)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documents/ (competitive analysis, requirements)
```

### System Integration
- **Input**: Raw transcript files
- **Processing**: Local LLM analysis and structuring
- **Output**: HubSpot CRM updates, Gmail drafts, organized documentation

## üö® CURRENT BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Immediate Blockers
- None identified (ready to begin development)

### Monitoring Risks
- **Transcript Quality**: ICS transcript is high quality, but future transcripts may vary
- **API Rate Limits**: LLM processing may hit rate limits with large transcripts
- **Competitive Sensitivity**: Need approval workflow for competitive intelligence outputs

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Quality Review**: Manual review step for critical transcripts
- **Batch Processing**: Throttling to handle API limitations
- **Approval Workflow**: Sales team review before any competitive intelligence sharing
