```
Companies/
└── {Company-Name}/
    ├── transcripts/
    │   ├── raw-transcript.txt
    │   └── processed/
    │       ├── analysis.yaml
    │       └── intelligence.json
    ├── emails/
    │   ├── outbound/
    │   └── templates/
    └── documents/
        ├── requirements-analysis.md
        ├── competitive-positioning.md
        └── proposal-outline.md
```

### Participant Role Analysis (From ICS Example)
