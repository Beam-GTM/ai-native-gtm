# KEY DISCOVERY: Workflow Trigger Clarification
trigger_discovery:
  primary_trigger: "new_company"
  description: "The starting trigger is a new company - whenever user has a new company, system creates folder structure"
  example_execution: "User identifies ICS as new company → System creates Companies/ICS/ structure"

system_dependencies:
  - "Local filesystem access for folder creation"
  - "Company naming standardization system"
  - "Folder structure template consistency"

integration_points:
  - "Companies folder as central repository"
  - "Transcript input mechanism (copy/paste initially)"
  - "Email generation system"
  - "File naming convention system"

hidden_complexities:
  - "Company name normalization (spaces, special characters, case sensitivity)"
  - "Duplicate company detection and handling"
  - "Folder structure consistency across different users/systems"
  - "File naming collision prevention within company folders"

risk_factors:
  - "Manual folder creation could lead to inconsistent naming"
  - "No validation for company name uniqueness"
  - "Folder structure could become disorganized without clear conventions"
  - "Manual process may not scale with high company volume"

coordination_needs:
  - "Clear company naming convention agreement"
  - "Standardized folder structure template"
  - "Process for handling edge cases (mergers, name changes)"

workflow_requirements:
  - "Automated company folder creation on new company trigger"
  - "Consistent folder structure: transcripts/emails/documents"
  - "Company name validation and normalization"

discovered_pattern:
  name: "Company-Centric Organization Pattern"
  description: "Simple, scalable pattern where each company gets standardized folder structure"
  structure: |
    Companies/
    └── {Company-Name}/
        ├── transcripts/
        ├── emails/
        └── documents/
        
validation_evidence:
  - "ICS folder structure successfully created as proof of concept"
  - "Simple three-folder pattern confirmed as user preference"
  - "Company-level organization validated over deal-level complexity"
