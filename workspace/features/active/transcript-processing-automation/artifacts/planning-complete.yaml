# SUMMARY
summary: |
  Comprehensive planning completed for transcript-processing-automation feature.
  Real-world analysis based on ICS RFI presentation transcript (900 lines) with 
  6 participants identified and business context captured. System designed to 
  process sales meeting transcripts and generate intelligent follow-up communications.

# ARTIFACTS GENERATED
artifacts:
  - "artifacts/feature-definition.yaml (Problem: 15-20 min â†’ 2-3 min follow-up time)"
