# üöÄ Nexus Quick Start: From Zero to Working Features in 15 Minutes

## üë§ **Who You Are**
**New to Cursor/Claude Code + AI Development**
- First time using AI-powered development
- Want to build features that actually work
- Need clear, simple guidance
- Want to avoid common mistakes

---

## üéØ **What Nexus Really Is** (30 seconds)
```
Traditional Development: Write Code ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Deploy
Nexus Development: Describe Intent ‚Üí AI Plans ‚Üí AI Builds ‚Üí You Validate
```

**Think of it as:** Having an AI development team that needs clear instructions and validation

---

## ‚ö° **Your First 5 Minutes: Setup**

### For Claude Code Users:
```bash
1. Download Nexus template
2. Open in Claude Code
3. Say: "claude hi"
4. System auto-detects and configures
```

### For Cursor Users:
```bash
1. Download Nexus template
2. Open in Cursor
3. Link: @orchestrator.md
4. Start conversation with AI
```

### Step 2: System Auto-Setup (60 seconds)
```
System: "üéØ FRESH TEMPLATE DETECTED! Choose setup path:"
You: "Go" (or "1" for Quick Setup)
System: Asks 4 simple questions
You: Answer them
Result: ‚úÖ System configured and ready!
```

## üé¨ **Live Example: Building Email Automation**

### **Session 1: Planning (What to Build)**

#### Claude Code:
```yaml
You: "claude hi"
System: [Shows menu]
You: "@plan-feature email-automation"
```

#### Cursor:
```yaml
You: "@orchestrator.md"
You: [Start conversation]
System: [Shows menu]
You: "@plan-feature email-automation"
```

**Both platforms then:**
```yaml
System asks:
- "What triggers the emails?"
- "Who receives them?"  
- "What content should they have?"
- "Any integrations needed?"

You answer each question.

System creates:
‚úÖ feature-definition.yaml
‚úÖ technical-design.yaml
‚úÖ resource-plan.yaml
‚úÖ PRD.md
‚úÖ progress.md

You: "@close-chat.md"  # CRITICAL - Saves everything!
```

### **Session 2: Implementation (How to Build)**
```yaml
[New session]
Claude Code: "claude hi"
Cursor: "@orchestrator.md"

System: [Remembers your feature]
You: "@implement-feature email-automation"

System creates workspace:
üìÅ email-automation/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prd.md (requirements)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md (tracking)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quality-gates.md (validation)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ active-context.md (current state)

You: "Now build the email sender function"
System: [Creates actual code]
You: "Test it"
System: [Runs tests]

You: "@close-chat.md"  # Saves progress
```

### **Session 3: Validation (Does it Work?)**
```yaml
[New session]
Claude Code: "claude hi"
Cursor: "@orchestrator.md"

You: "Let's validate email-automation"

ULTRATHINK Questions:
‚ùì "Show me it actually sending an email"
‚ùì "What happens if email fails?"
‚ùì "Where's the proof it works?"

You provide evidence:
‚úÖ Test email sent successfully
‚úÖ Error handling demonstrated
‚úÖ Configuration verified

You: "@close-chat.md"  # Marks feature complete
```

---

## üö® **TOP 5 BEGINNER MISTAKES** (Avoid These!)

### ‚ùå **Mistake #1: Forgetting to close chat properly**
```
Impact: Lose all your work and context
Fix: ALWAYS end with "@close-chat.md" - it triggers 5 automatic save systems
Remember: @close-chat.md = Save button
Safe alternatives: "close-chat" or "close" or "@close-chat.md"
```

### ‚ùå **Mistake #2: Trying to build without planning**
```
Impact: AI doesn't know what you want, builds wrong thing
Fix: Always start with "@plan-feature [name]"
Remember: 20 minutes planning saves 2 hours fixing
```

### ‚ùå **Mistake #3: Not testing (Success Theater)**
```
AI says: "Feature complete!"
Reality: You never tested it
Fix: ALWAYS demand proof - "Show me it working"
Remember: No proof = Not done
Use ULTRATHINK validation!
```

### ‚ùå **Mistake #4: Not using @ for files**
```
Bad: "run close-chat"
Good: "@close-chat.md"
Remember: Always use @filename to be safe
```

### ‚ùå **Mistake #5: Multiple interfering features**
```
OK: Multiple features if they're independent
Bad: Features that conflict or share code
Fix: Complete one before starting another if they interfere
Remember: Parallel is fine if features don't overlap
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **The ULTRATHINK Safety Net**

### What It Is
A **CRITICAL validation system** that forces you to prove things actually work

### The 5 Questions That Save You (MUST USE!)
1. **"What did we ACTUALLY test?"** (Not what we configured)
2. **"Can we PROVE it works?"** (Show me the output)
3. **"What BROKE that we're ignoring?"** (Be honest)
4. **"What files appeared that we don't understand?"** (Mystery = danger)
5. **"Are we pretending or achieving?"** (Documentation ‚â† Implementation)

### When to Use ULTRATHINK
- **MANDATORY**: End of EVERY session
- **MANDATORY**: Before marking ANYTHING complete
- **CRITICAL**: When something seems "too easy"
- **ESSENTIAL**: During @close-chat.md workflow

---

## üìä **Success Metrics: How You Know It's Working**

### ‚úÖ **Good Signs**
- Your features have 5 planning files before building starts
- You can show actual output/results (not just code)
- Each session ends with "@close-chat.md"
- ULTRATHINK validation passes with evidence
- System remembers your work between sessions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning Signs**
- Lots of documentation but nothing runs
- Can't show proof of functionality
- Lost context between sessions (forgot @close-chat.md)
- Skipping ULTRATHINK validation
- Interfering features running in parallel

## üéØ **Your Action Plan**

### **Today (15 minutes)**

#### Claude Code:
1. Setup Nexus in Claude Code
2. Say "claude hi"
3. Run quick setup ("Go")
4. Try: `@plan-feature hello-world`
5. Say "@close-chat.md" to save

#### Cursor:
1. Setup Nexus in Cursor
2. Link @orchestrator.md
3. Start conversation
4. Run quick setup ("Go")
5. Try: `@plan-feature hello-world`
6. Say "@close-chat.md" to save

### **Tomorrow (45 minutes)**
1. New session (claude hi OR @orchestrator.md)
2. `@implement-feature hello-world`
3. Build something simple
4. Test it with ULTRATHINK
5. Say "@close-chat.md"

### **Day 3 (30 minutes)**
1. New session (claude hi OR @orchestrator.md)
2. Validate with ULTRATHINK (5 questions)
3. Get proof it works
4. Mark complete
5. "@close-chat.md"
6. Celebrate! üéâ

## üí° **Remember These 5 Things**

1. **Always use @close-chat.md** - It's your save button
2. **Start correctly** - Claude Code: "claude hi" | Cursor: "@orchestrator.md"
3. **ULTRATHINK validation** - Use it EVERY session
4. **Plan before building** - Use @plan-feature first
5. **Parallel OK if independent** - Multiple features fine if not interfering

---

## üöÄ **Quick Command Reference**

### Starting a Session:
```bash
# Claude Code
claude hi                   # Start system in Claude Code

# Cursor
@orchestrator.md           # Start system in Cursor
```

### Essential Commands (Both Platforms):
```bash
@plan-feature [name]        # Plan what to build
@implement-feature [name]   # Build from plan
@close-chat.md             # SAVE EVERYTHING (Critical!)
close-chat / close         # Alternative save commands

# When stuck
explain [what confused you] # Get help
@agent developer.md        # Talk to coding specialist
@agent architect.md        # Talk to design specialist
```
