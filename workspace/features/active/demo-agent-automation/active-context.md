## üìã Current Session Context

### Feature Overview
**Problem**: Manual repetitive work creating demo agents for high-value clients
**Solution**: Template-driven automation tool with webhook integration
**Key Insight**: "Intern-level clarity" for prompts with explicit decision branches

### Planning Phase Complete ‚úÖ
- Feature definition captured
- Elicitation insights documented  
- Technical architecture designed
- ULTRATHINK validation passed (avoided overengineering)

### Implementation Phase Started ‚úÖ
- Complete workspace created
- PRD generated from planning artifacts
- Progress tracking configured (3 phases, 5-8 weeks)
- Quality gates established (5 gates with PASS/FAIL framework)

## üéØ Current Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Set up development environment** for core generation engine
2. **Design template system architecture** for workflows  
3. **Create first workflow template** for testing
4. **Begin prompt clarity guidelines** definition

### Active Phase: **Phase 1 - Core Generation Engine**
**Timeline**: Weeks 1-3  
**Goal**: Basic generation capabilities functional

**Current Sprint Priority**:
- [ ] Template System Foundation
- [ ] Basic Workflow Templates  
- [ ] Prompt Generation with Clarity Guidelines
- [ ] Test Case Generation Aligned with Prompts

## üí° Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Template-Driven Generation**: Scalable across different demo types
- **4 Core Components**: Workflow Generator, Prompt Engineer, Test Case Generator, Deployment Manager
- **Local Generation + Webhook Deployment**: Reliable pattern

### Design Principles Established
- **Intern-Level Clarity**: Explicit enough for minimal context
- **Decision Branch Logic**: Clear if/then statements in prompts
- **Test Synchronization**: Test cases must match prompt logic exactly
- **General Purpose**: Not domain-specific, works across demo types

### Scope Decisions
- **Simplified Approach**: ULTRATHINK correction prevented overengineering
- **Practical Tool Focus**: Automation over theoretical framework
- **Webhook Integration**: Standard POST (user will provide example)

---

## üîÑ Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- **Webhook Example**: User will provide format and authentication details (needed for Phase 3)
- **Platform Compatibility**: Generated agents must work with existing platform

### Internal Dependencies
- Template system architecture (Phase 1)
- Prompt clarity validation system (Phase 2)
- Webhook integration implementation (Phase 3)

### Current Blockers
- None - ready to begin Phase 1 implementation

## üìä Progress Snapshot

### Overall Progress: 0% (Implementation Starting)

**Phase 1 (Core Engine)**: 0% - Not Started
- Workflow Generator: 0%
- Prompt Engineer: 0%  
- Test Case Generator: 0%
- Basic Integration: 0%

**Upcoming Milestones**:
- Phase 1 Complete: Core generation functional

## üß† Lessons Learned

### From Planning Phase
- **ULTRATHINK Effectiveness**: Successfully prevented overengineering
- **User Clarity**: "Intern-level clarity" metaphor very effective
- **Scope Management**: General-purpose approach better than domain-specific

### Implementation Notes
- Keep focus on practical automation
- Resist feature creep during development
- Prioritize simplicity over sophistication

---

## üîß Development Environment

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Template engine, JSON processing, HTTP client for webhook
- Core Logic: Prompt optimization, test generation, workflow creation
- Integration: Webhook deployment, error handling

### Development Approach
- Start with simplest viable templates
- Build iteratively with user feedback
- Test early and often with real scenarios
