## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gate Framework

Each gate must achieve **PASS** status before proceeding to the next phase. Any **FAIL** status blocks progression until resolved.

## üö® Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Webhook Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Unknown format/auth requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Get example early, test thoroughly
   - **Gate Impact**: Could block Gate 5

2. **Prompt Quality Validation**
   - **Risk**: "Intern-level clarity" hard to measure
   - **Mitigation**: Define concrete criteria, user testing
   - **Gate Impact**: Could block Gate 3

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Template Maintenance**
   - **Risk**: Templates become outdated or poor quality
   - **Mitigation**: Version control, quality guidelines
   - **Gate Impact**: Could affect Gate 4

2. **Performance Targets**
   - **Risk**: Generation takes longer than 5 seconds
   - **Mitigation**: Profile and optimize critical paths
   - **Gate Impact**: Could block Gate 3

## üîÑ Gate Review Process

### Gate Review Meeting
- **Frequency**: At end of each phase
- **Attendees**: Developer, User, QA (if applicable)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes maximum
- **Output**: PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED decision

### Decision Criteria
- **PASS**: All criteria met, evidence complete
- **CONCERNS**: Minor issues, can proceed with monitoring
- **FAIL**: Critical issues, must resolve before proceeding
- **WAIVED**: Criteria not applicable or user accepts risk

### Escalation
- **FAIL** decisions require resolution plan
- **WAIVED** decisions require user sign-off
- All decisions documented with rationale
