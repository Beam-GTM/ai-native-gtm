## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Workflow Components**
- **Document Intake & Validation** - Screens for completeness and validity
- **Data Extraction & OCR** - Extracts customer information from documents
- **Risk Assessment & PEP Check** - Applies risk-based segmentation
- **Identity Verification** - Verifies document authenticity and identity
- **Decision Engine** - Makes approval/rejection decisions with clear reasoning
- **Customer Notification** - Handles all customer communications

### **Decision Logic**
Each component uses explicit decision trees with clear branching:
```
DECISION TREE:
1. Check document completeness:
   - ID document present? (Passport, Driver's License, National ID)
   - Proof of address present? (Utility bill, bank statement, lease agreement)
   - If business: incorporation documents present?
   - If high-risk: additional documents required?
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Document Storage:** Dropbox, Google Drive, AWS S3
- **Verification APIs:** ComplyAdvantage, World-Check, OFAC
- **CRM Systems:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Custom CRM
- **Notifications:** Email, SMS, Slack, In-app
