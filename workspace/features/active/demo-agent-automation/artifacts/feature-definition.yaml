feature_name: "demo-agent-automation"
created_date: "2025-09-18T09:01:25Z"
feature_type: "integration"
priority: "high"

problem_statement: |
  Manual repetitive work creating demo agents for high-value clients requiring:
  1. Step-by-step text-based process flow design
  2. Optimized prompt engineering with low ambiguity for high straight-through processing rates  
  3. Matching test case development aligned with prompt optimization
  4. Agent deployment via standard webhook integration
  5. Lack of structured, repeatable methodology across client demos

success_criteria:
  - "Standardized demo creation process with step-by-step text-based workflows"
  - "Optimized prompt templates engineered for maximum straight-through processing rates with low ambiguity"
  - "Automated agent deployment via webhook integration with consistent, reliable execution"
