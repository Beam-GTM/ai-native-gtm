## 🎯 Overview

This guide demonstrates how to build a comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) agent using the demo-agent-automation framework, enhanced with real-world patterns from Notion MCP agent templates.

### Key Features Built:
- **Document Intake & Validation** (from KYC Intake Agent)
- **Identity Verification** (from KYC Verification Agent) 
- **Renewal Management** (from KYC Renewal Agent)
- **Risk Assessment & Compliance** (from multiple Notion templates)
- **Automated Decision Making** (with intern-level clarity)

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

1. **Access Demo Agent Automation Framework**
   ```bash
   cd workspace/features/active/demo-agent-automation/
   ```

2. **Review Framework Components**
   - `technical-design.yaml` - Core architecture
   - `feature-definition.yaml` - Feature specifications
   - `comprehensive-kyc-agent.yaml` - Our KYC implementation

### Step 2: Configure KYC Agent

1. **Document Ingestion Setup**
   ```yaml
   tools:
     - "📁 Document Ingestion (Dropbox, Drive, Email)"
     - "🔍 OCR & NLP (Beam AI, Amazon Textract)"
     - "✅ Sanctions / PEP API (ComplyAdvantage, World-Check)"
   ```

2. **Decision Tree Configuration**
   - Use the intern-level clarity prompts from `comprehensive-kyc-agent.yaml`
   - Configure decision thresholds for risk levels
   - Set up escalation rules for manual review

3. **Integration Endpoints**
   ```yaml
   integration_endpoints:
     document_storage: ["Dropbox API", "Google Drive API", "AWS S3"]
     verification_services: ["ComplyAdvantage API", "World-Check API"]
     crm_systems: ["Salesforce API", "HubSpot API"]
   ```

### Step 3: Test Scenarios

Run the 5 test scenarios provided:

1. **Low Risk Individual** → Auto Approval
2. **High Risk Business** → Manual Review  
3. **PEP Customer** → Enhanced Due Diligence
4. **Document Issues** → Request Resubmission
5. **Sanctions Match** → Auto Reject

### Step 4: Performance Validation

Expected metrics based on Notion agent data:
- **Manual Review Reduction:** 70%
- **Time to KYC Completion:** < 2 hours
- **Exception Identification Rate:** 93%
- **Auto Approval Rate:** 85%

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Workflow Components

1. **Document Intake Agent**
   ```yaml
   name: "Document Ingestion & Validation"
   description: "Screens customer-submitted documents for completeness and validity"
   decision_points:
     - "Are all required documents present?"
     - "Are documents valid format and not expired?"
     - "Are there signs of tampering or fraud?"
   ```

2. **Risk Assessment Agent**
   ```yaml
   name: "Risk-Based Segmentation"
   description: "Applies risk-based segmentation (high-risk jurisdictions, PEPs)"
   decision_points:
     - "Is customer from high-risk jurisdiction?"
     - "Is customer a Politically Exposed Person (PEP)?"
     - "What is the overall risk score?"
   ```

3. **Decision Engine**
   ```yaml
   name: "Approval Decision & Routing"
   description: "Makes final approval decision or routes for manual review"
   decision_points:
     - "Should customer be auto-approved?"
     - "Should customer be auto-rejected?"
     - "Should case be escalated for manual review?"
   ```

### Prompt Engineering (Intern-Level Clarity)

Each component uses explicit decision trees with clear branching logic:

```yaml
DECISION TREE:
1. Check document completeness:
   - ID document present? (Passport, Driver's License, National ID)
   - Proof of address present? (Utility bill, bank statement, lease agreement)
   - If business: incorporation documents present?
   - If high-risk: additional documents required?

2. Validate document quality:
   - Is document clearly readable and not blurry?
   - Is document not expired (check expiration dates)?
   - Are there signs of tampering or editing?
   - Is document in acceptable format (PDF, JPEG, PNG)?
```
