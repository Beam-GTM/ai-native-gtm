# Focus: Practical automation requirements

core_insights:
  clarity_principle: "Intern-level clarity - explicit enough for someone with minimal context"
  decision_branches: "Clear, unambiguous paths with explicit 'if X then Y' logic"
  test_alignment: "Test cases must exactly match prompt decision paths"
  scope: "General-purpose across different demo types (not domain-specific)"

system_integration_points:
  webhook_deployment:
    - "Standard POST endpoint for agent triggering"
    - "User will provide specific format and authentication details"
    - "Payload includes: process flow, prompts, test cases"
  
  prompt_optimization:
    - "Avoid stiff decision branches that confuse AI"
    - "Provide explicit instructions for each decision point"
    - "Structure like intern training manual - step by step"

hidden_complexities_discovered:
  - "Balancing explicit clarity vs. prompt length"
  - "Maintaining test case synchronization with prompt changes"
  - "Creating reusable templates across diverse demo types"

risk_factors:
  - "Over-specification leading to rigid prompts"
  - "Test case drift from prompt logic"
  - "Webhook integration failure during live demos"

coordination_needs:
  minimal: "User provides webhook example when ready for integration"
