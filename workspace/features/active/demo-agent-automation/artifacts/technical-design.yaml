# Architect: Technical architecture for practical automation tool

architecture_approach: "Template-Driven Generation with structured automation workflows"

key_components:
  workflow_generator:
    purpose: "Create step-by-step text-based process flows for demo agents"
    input: "Demo type, client context, business objectives"
    output: "Structured workflow with clear decision points and execution steps"
    implementation: "Template-based system with customizable step libraries"
    
  prompt_engineer:
    purpose: "Generate intern-level clarity prompts optimized for straight-through processing"
    key_features:
      - "Decision branch optimization with clear if/then logic"
      - "Ambiguity detection and clarity scoring"
      - "Best practice template library for common patterns"
    validation: "Automated prompt clarity assessment"
    
  test_case_generator:
    purpose: "Create test cases that exactly match prompt decision logic"
    sync_mechanism: "Auto-generate from prompt decision branches"
    validation: "Verify test cases cover all prompt execution paths"
    output: "Structured test scenarios with expected outcomes and success criteria"
    
  deployment_manager:
    purpose: "Package complete demo agent and deploy via webhook"
    payload_structure: "Workflow + Prompts + Test Cases in JSON format"
    integration: "Standard webhook POST (format TBD from user example)"
    error_handling: "Retry logic, failure notifications, deployment status tracking"

integration_points:
  webhook_deployment:
    method: "HTTP POST to user-provided endpoint"
    authentication: "TBD - user will provide authentication method"
    payload_format: "JSON with workflow, prompts, and test cases"
    response_handling: "Success confirmation and error management"
    
  template_system:
    storage: "Local template library for workflows and prompts"
    customization: "User-configurable templates for different demo types"
    expansion: "Easy addition of new templates and patterns"

implementation_phases:
  phase_1_core_engine:
    scope: "Basic generation capabilities"
    deliverables:
      - "Template-based workflow creation"
      - "Prompt generation with clarity guidelines"
      - "Simple test case creation aligned with prompts"
    duration: "2-3 weeks"
    
  phase_2_optimization:
    scope: "Quality and validation enhancements"
    deliverables:
      - "Prompt ambiguity detection algorithms"
      - "Test case synchronization validation"
      - "Template library expansion and optimization"
    duration: "2-3 weeks"
    
  phase_3_integration:
    scope: "Deployment and production readiness"
    deliverables:
      - "Webhook integration implementation"
      - "Live deployment testing and validation"
      - "Error handling and monitoring systems"
    duration: "1-2 weeks"

performance_considerations:
  speed: "Sub-second generation for standard demo configurations"
  scalability: "Template-based approach scales linearly with new demo types"
  reliability: "Local generation + webhook deployment pattern ensures consistency"
  maintainability: "Clear separation of concerns with modular component design"

dependencies:
  technical:
    - "User-provided webhook endpoint and authentication details"
    - "Example payload format from existing platform"
    - "Template library for common demo patterns"
  
  external:
    - "Webhook endpoint availability and reliability"
    - "Platform compatibility with generated agent configurations"

success_metrics:
  generation_speed: "< 5 seconds for complete demo agent package"
  prompt_clarity: "Measurable reduction in ambiguous decision points"
  test_alignment: "100% coverage of prompt decision branches in test cases"
  deployment_reliability: "> 99% successful webhook deployments"
