prompt_templates:
  document_validation_prompt: |
    **KYC Document Validation - Step 1**
    
    You are processing a customer's KYC documents. Your task is to validate each document for completeness and authenticity.
    
    **INPUT DOCUMENTS:**
    - Government ID: {government_id_document}
    - Proof of Address: {address_document}
    - Additional Docs: {additional_documents}
    
    **VALIDATION RULES:**
    1. **Document Clarity**: Is the document clearly readable and not blurry?
    2. **Information Completeness**: Are all required fields present and legible?
    3. **Authenticity Indicators**: Does the document show signs of tampering or forgery?
    4. **Date Validity**: Is the document current and not expired?
    
    **DECISION LOGIC:**
    - IF all documents are clear AND complete AND authentic AND current → PROCEED to identity verification
    - IF any document is unclear OR incomplete OR suspicious → FLAG for manual review with specific reason
    - IF documents are expired → REJECT with "Document expiration" reason
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    ```json
    {
      "validation_status": "approved|flagged|rejected",
      "document_scores": {
        "government_id": "pass|fail|flag",
        "proof_of_address": "pass|fail|flag",
        "additional_docs": "pass|fail|flag"
      },
      "flags": ["specific_issue_1", "specific_issue_2"],
      "next_action": "proceed|manual_review|reject"
    }
    ```

  identity_verification_prompt: |
    **KYC Identity Verification - Step 2**
    
    You are verifying a customer's identity using validated documents and external sources.
    
    **CUSTOMER INFORMATION:**
    - Full Name: {customer_full_name}
    - Date of Birth: {date_of_birth}
    - Address: {customer_address}
    - Government ID Number: {id_number}
    
    **VERIFICATION SOURCES:**
    1. **Government Database**: Check official records
    2. **Credit Bureau**: Verify identity history
    3. **Watchlist Screening**: Check against sanctions/PEP lists
    
    **VERIFICATION RULES:**
    1. **Name Match**: Does the name match across all sources?
    2. **Address Verification**: Does the address match government records?
    3. **ID Validation**: Is the government ID valid and not reported stolen?
    4. **Watchlist Check**: Is the customer on any sanctions or PEP lists?
    
    **DECISION LOGIC:**
    - IF all verifications PASS AND no watchlist matches → PROCEED to risk assessment
    - IF any verification FAILS → FLAG for manual review with specific failure reason
    - IF watchlist MATCH found → IMMEDIATE rejection with compliance reason
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    ```json
    {
      "verification_status": "verified|flagged|rejected",
      "verification_results": {
        "government_db": "pass|fail|error",
        "credit_bureau": "pass|fail|error",
        "watchlist_screening": "clear|match|error"
      },
      "match_details": "specific_watchlist_match_if_any",
      "next_action": "proceed|manual_review|reject"
    }
    ```

  risk_assessment_prompt: |
    **KYC Risk Assessment - Step 3**
    
    You are assessing the customer's risk profile based on verified identity and available information.
    
    **CUSTOMER PROFILE:**
    - Occupation: {occupation}
    - Income Range: {income_range}
    - Geographic Location: {customer_location}
    - Transaction History: {transaction_history}
    - Document Quality Score: {document_quality_score}
    
    **RISK FACTORS TO EVALUATE:**
    1. **Geographic Risk**: High/Medium/Low based on location
    2. **Occupation Risk**: High/Medium/Low based on profession
    3. **Income Consistency**: Does income match occupation level?
    4. **Transaction Patterns**: Any unusual or high-risk patterns?
    5. **Document Quality**: How reliable are the provided documents?
    
    **RISK SCORING LOGIC:**
    - Geographic Risk: High-risk countries = +3, Medium = +1, Low = 0
    - Occupation Risk: High-risk professions = +2, Medium = +1, Low = 0
    - Income Consistency: Inconsistent = +2, Consistent = 0
    - Document Quality: Poor quality = +2, Good quality = 0
    - Transaction Patterns: Unusual = +3, Normal = 0
    
    **TOTAL SCORE CALCULATION:**
    - 0-2 points = LOW RISK
    - 3-5 points = MEDIUM RISK  
    - 6+ points = HIGH RISK
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    ```json
    {
      "risk_score": 0-10,
      "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
      "risk_factors": {
        "geographic": "low|medium|high",
        "occupation": "low|medium|high",
        "income_consistency": "consistent|inconsistent",
        "document_quality": "good|poor",
        "transaction_patterns": "normal|unusual"
      },
      "next_action": "proceed|enhanced_monitoring|manual_review"
    }
    ```

  compliance_decision_prompt: |
    **KYC Compliance Decision - Step 4**
    
    You are making the final compliance decision based on all verification and risk assessment results.
    
    **INPUT DATA:**
    - Verification Status: {verification_status}
    - Risk Score: {risk_score}
    - Risk Level: {risk_level}
    - Document Quality: {document_quality}
    - Watchlist Status: {watchlist_status}
    
    **COMPLIANCE DECISION MATRIX:**
    1. **VERIFICATION STATUS = FAILED** → IMMEDIATE REJECTION
    2. **WATCHLIST MATCH = YES** → IMMEDIATE REJECTION
    3. **RISK LEVEL = HIGH** → MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED
    4. **RISK LEVEL = MEDIUM** → APPROVED WITH ENHANCED MONITORING
    5. **RISK LEVEL = LOW** → APPROVED WITH STANDARD MONITORING
    
    **ENHANCED MONITORING TRIGGERS:**
    - Transaction amount > $10,000
    - Unusual geographic transactions
    - Frequent large cash transactions
    - Changes to customer profile
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
    ```json
    {
      "compliance_decision": "approved|rejected|manual_review",
      "monitoring_level": "standard|enhanced|manual",
      "approval_conditions": ["condition1", "condition2"],
      "next_steps": "account_activation|manual_review|rejection_letter",
      "compliance_notes": "specific_reasoning_for_decision"
    }
