# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Feature: Demo Agent Automation

**Created**: 2025-09-18T09:01:25Z  
**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Integration/Process Automation

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Currently experiencing repetitive manual work creating demo agents for high-value clients requiring:
1. Step-by-step text-based process flow design
2. Optimized prompt engineering with low ambiguity for high straight-through processing rates  
3. Matching test case development aligned with prompt optimization
4. Agent deployment via standard webhook integration
5. Lack of structured, repeatable methodology across client demos

**Business Impact**: Manual repetitive work reduces efficiency and consistency in high-value client demos.

## 2. Success Criteria

- **Standardized demo creation process** with step-by-step text-based workflows
- **Optimized prompt templates** engineered for maximum straight-through processing rates with low ambiguity
- **Automated agent deployment** via webhook integration with consistent, reliable execution

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Architecture Approach
Template-Driven Generation with structured automation workflows

### Key Components

#### 3.1 Workflow Generator
- **Purpose**: Create step-by-step text-based process flows for demo agents
- **Input**: Demo type, client context, business objectives
- **Output**: Structured workflow with clear decision points and execution steps
- **Implementation**: Template-based system with customizable step libraries

#### 3.2 Prompt Engineer
- **Purpose**: Generate intern-level clarity prompts optimized for straight-through processing
- **Key Features**:
  - Decision branch optimization with clear if/then logic
  - Ambiguity detection and clarity scoring
  - Best practice template library for common patterns
- **Validation**: Automated prompt clarity assessment

#### 3.3 Test Case Generator
- **Purpose**: Create test cases that exactly match prompt decision logic
- **Sync Mechanism**: Auto-generate from prompt decision branches
- **Validation**: Verify test cases cover all prompt execution paths
- **Output**: Structured test scenarios with expected outcomes and success criteria

#### 3.4 Deployment Manager
- **Purpose**: Package complete demo agent and deploy via webhook
- **Payload Structure**: Workflow + Prompts + Test Cases in JSON format
- **Integration**: Standard webhook POST (format TBD from user example)
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic, failure notifications, deployment status tracking

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine (2-3 weeks)
**Scope**: Basic generation capabilities
**Deliverables**:
- Template-based workflow creation
- Prompt generation with clarity guidelines
- Simple test case creation aligned with prompts

### Phase 2: Optimization (2-3 weeks)
**Scope**: Quality and validation enhancements
**Deliverables**:
- Prompt ambiguity detection algorithms
- Test case synchronization validation
- Template library expansion and optimization

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 weeks)
**Scope**: Deployment and production readiness
**Deliverables**:
- Webhook integration implementation
- Live deployment testing and validation
- Error handling and monitoring systems

## 5. Key Requirements

### 5.1 Clarity Principle
- **"Intern-level clarity"**: Explicit enough for someone with minimal context
- **Decision branches**: Clear, unambiguous paths with explicit "if X then Y" logic
- **Test alignment**: Test cases must exactly match prompt decision paths
- **Scope**: General-purpose across different demo types (not domain-specific)

### 5.2 Integration Points
- **Webhook deployment**: Standard POST endpoint for agent triggering
- **Authentication**: User will provide specific format and authentication details
- **Payload**: Includes process flow, prompts, test cases

### 5.3 System Requirements
- **Template system**: Local template library for workflows and prompts
- **Customization**: User-configurable templates for different demo types
- **Performance**: Sub-second generation for standard demo configurations

## 6. Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- User-provided webhook endpoint and authentication details
- Example payload format from existing platform
- Template library for common demo patterns

### External Dependencies
- Webhook endpoint availability and reliability
- Platform compatibility with generated agent configurations

## 7. Success Metrics

- **Generation Speed**: < 5 seconds for complete demo agent package
- **Prompt Clarity**: Measurable reduction in ambiguous decision points
- **Test Alignment**: 100% coverage of prompt decision branches in test cases
- **Deployment Reliability**: > 99% successful webhook deployments

## 8. Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Template System
- Template-based workflow creation functional
- Basic prompt generation with clarity guidelines
- Simple test case creation aligned with prompts

### Gate 2: Optimization Layer
- Prompt ambiguity detection working
- Test case synchronization validation implemented
- Template library expanded and optimized

### Gate 3: Integration Ready
- Webhook integration implemented and tested
- Live deployment validation complete
- Error handling and monitoring operational

## 9. Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Prompt optimization complexity** → Mitigation: Start with simple clarity rules, iterate
- **Webhook integration unknowns** → Mitigation: Get example early, test thoroughly  
- **Template maintenance overhead** → Mitigation: Design for easy template updates

### Medium Risks
- Template quality ensuring "intern-level clarity"
- Test case synchronization with prompt changes
- Webhook reliability during live demos

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 1**: Core generation engine with templates
2. **Get webhook example** from user for integration design
3. **Build prompt clarity validation** system
4. **Create test case synchronization** logic
