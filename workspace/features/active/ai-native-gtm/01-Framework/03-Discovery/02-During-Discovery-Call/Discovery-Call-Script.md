## Key Components
- Structured call flow with timing
- Sample scripts and questions

- Trial closing strategies
- Next steps framework

## 1. ðŸŸ¢ Critical Kick-Off (5 mins)

### Goals
- Establish rapport & credibility quickly
- Confirm meeting structure & set expectations
- Introduce Beam AI's unique approach succinctly
- Secure conceptual agreement for next steps

### Sample Opening Script
> "Hi {First Name}, great to meet youâ€”where are you dialing in from today?"
> "I appreciate your schedule must be packed, are we still good for the full 30 minutes?"
> "To quickly frame today's call: First, we'll do brief introsâ€”I'd love to hear a bit more about your priorities and challenges this year. Then I'll give you a high-level introduction to Beam AI's agentic platformâ€”particularly how our self-learning agents help automate complex workflows in companies like yours. Lastly, we'll allocate time for Q&A to see if there's potential alignment. If there's a fit, we can book a personalized demo to dive deeper; if not, absolutely no worriesâ€”we're always evolving, and it's great to build a connection regardless. How does that sound to you?"
> "Anything specific you'd like to cover today that I can make sure to include?"

### Triple Question Transition
> "Greatâ€”so {First Name}, could you briefly introduce yourself, outline some of your key priorities for the year, and perhaps share your initial thoughts on what you're hoping Beam's AI Agents could potentially achieve at {Company Name}?"

## 2. ðŸŸ¡ Discovery & Deep Dive (10-15 mins)

### Goal
- Uncover deep insights about **Status**, **Issues**, and their **Consequences**
- Position Beam's unique advantages organically

### Beam's Methodology
- **Active Listening** â€“ Keep detailed notes, capture precise customer language
- **Consultative Framing (TPV)** â€“ "Executives at Trade Republic mentioned their biggest friction point was scaling automation reliably without losing visibility. Is this something you've experienced?"
- **Hypothesis-driven Conversation** â€“ "Imagine, six months from now, if you could eliminate repetitive manual work in [specific task], what strategic initiatives could your team focus on instead?"
- **Humble Disclaimers** â€“ "Would it be alright if I asked a few questions about your current workflows? I want to make sure Beam is genuinely a good fit before we dive deeper."

### High-Leverage Questions

#### Framing Questions
- "We often work with teams who are stretched thin with repetitive tasks and want scalable AI that doesn't just assist â€” but actually acts. What does that look like on your side?"

#### Problem/Status Questions
- "Where do you see the biggest drag or bottleneck on your team's productivity right now?"
- "What processes feel like they should already be automated â€” but aren't â€” and why?"
- "What kind of AI use cases are you exploring today, if any?"

#### Current Tools/Approach Questions
- "Have you experimented with RPA, internal AI tools, or LLM copilots? What worked, what didn't?"
- "Could you walk me through a typical process in [HR onboarding, invoice processing, compliance] where you're currently experiencing friction?"

#### Desired Outcomes Questions
- "Imagine it's 6 months from now â€” what would success with AI agents look like for you?"
- "Is your team more interested in reducing operational cost, improving speed, or eliminating error-prone work?"
- "What impact does this have operationallyâ€”are you noticing delays, inaccuracies, or increased costs?"

#### Beam Fit Expansion (TPV)
- "Other teams we work with â€” like Trade Republic and BitCob â€” typically start with one agent (like onboarding or invoice validation) and then scale out to 5â€“10 roles within months. Does that kind of phased rollout make sense to you?"

#### Buy-in + Blockers Questions
- "Who else needs to be involved for a deployment like this?"
- "What might stand in the way of launching something like Beam in the next quarter?"
- "How are decisions about new technologies typically evaluated internally?"

### Framing & Summarizing Example
- "You mentioned earlier that repetitive manual entry is causing your team frustrationâ€”just to check, reducing that 'mind-numbing' work would significantly boost morale and productivity, is that right?"

### Trial Close Example
- "Based on what we've discussed so far, does it feel like Beam's self-learning agents could address some of these pain points effectively?"

## 3. ðŸ”µ Align & Outline Next Steps (5 mins)

### Goal
- Succinctly summarize identified challenges & Beam's potential impact
- Set clear expectations and lock down next step (demo/workshop)

### Example Script
> "Thanks, {First Name}. To quickly summarize, it sounds like your current manual workflow around [specific problem] is slowing down your team and preventing you from tackling strategic tasks. From what we've covered, Beam AI's agentsâ€”particularly with their ability to learn from your team's feedback and continuously improve accuracyâ€”could streamline these processes significantly, freeing your people for higher-value activities. Does that sound aligned with your perspective?"
> "As a next step, I suggest we schedule a personalized demo, so you can see our agents in action, specifically tailored around your use case at {Company Name}. Would that be helpful?"

### Get Confirmation & Book Next Step
- "Fantasticâ€”let's schedule the demo now. Would [day/time] work for your team, or is there a better slot?"

### Alternative Next Steps
- Discovery workshop
- Demo tailored to a use case
- Proof-of-value pilot proposal

## 4. ðŸŸ£ Wrap-Up & Finishing Touch (2-5 mins)

### Goal
- End positively, reinforce rapport, and gather quick qualitative feedback

### Example Closing Questions
- "We wrapped up a bit early, so I'll give you some time back. Out of curiosity, was there anything specific from today's conversation that resonated particularly strongly?"
- "Just to finish on a lighter noteâ€”any exciting plans lined up for the weekend?"
