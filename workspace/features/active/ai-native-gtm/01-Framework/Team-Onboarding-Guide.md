# **PART 3: HOW TO USE IT DAILY** 🎯

## **🚀 Session Management Guide**

### **1. START Your Session**

**Always Start with Orchestrator**
```
1. Open orchestrator agent (@orchestrator)
2. Let it load the system and show you the menu
3. Choose what you want to work on from the options

### **3. CLOSE Your Session (CRITICAL)**

**Always Close with Learning Capture**
```
1. Type "@close-chat" or "close" or "bye"
2. The system will run the close-chat workflow
3. This captures all your work and learnings
4. Updates system memory and syncs progress
5. Prepares for your next session
```

**Why Closing is Essential:**
- **Learning Capture**: System learns from your work patterns
- **Progress Preservation**: All your work is saved and synced
- **Context Continuity**: Next session picks up where you left off
- **System Evolution**: Your usage improves the system for everyone
- **Memory Management**: Keeps system optimized and fast

### **🔗 MCPs (Model Context Protocols)**

### **✅ Essential Best Practices**

**DO - Essential Habits:**
- **Always use @close-chat**: It's your save button - triggers 5-engine closure
- **Start correctly**: Claude Code: "claude hi" | Cursor: "@orchestrator.md"
- **ULTRATHINK validation**: Use it EVERY session for evidence-based assessment
- **Plan before building**: Use @plan-feature first for proper requirements
- **One feature per session**: Complete cycles for focused development

**DON'T - Common Mistakes:**
- **Skip close-chat**: You'll lose all progress and memory
- **Build without planning**: Leads to wrong implementations
- **Trust without verification**: Always demand proof with ULTRATHINK
- **Forget @ prefix**: Use @filename format for commands
- **Run conflicting features**: Keep parallel features independent
