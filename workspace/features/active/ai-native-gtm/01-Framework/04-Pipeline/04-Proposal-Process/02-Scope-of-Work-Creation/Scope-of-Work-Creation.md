Beam AI will follow the SOC2 standard for security and data privacy. To ensure data protection and security, the following measures will be implemented:

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, including customer queries and product information, will be encrypted during transmission and storage
- **Compliance**: The agents will comply with relevant data protection regulations to safeguard customer privacy
- **Access Controls**: Granular login permissions will be implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel only

#### Main Benefits of Beam
- **Rapid deployment** of an operational MVP within 6 weeks, showcasing immediate efficiency gains
- **Minimal requirement** for technical team involvement, facilitating an easy and efficient integration process
- **Scalability** of the solution for future automation needs, further enhancing operational efficiency and offering quality
