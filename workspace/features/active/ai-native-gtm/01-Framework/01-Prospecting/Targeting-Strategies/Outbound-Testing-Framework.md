# Outbound Testing Framework
**Purpose**: Systematic approach to testing outbound strategies  
**Status**: In Development

## Testing Methodology
### Hypothesis-Driven Testing
- **Hypothesis**: [Specific hypothesis to test]
- **Success Metrics**: [How to measure success]
- **Test Duration**: [Recommended test period]
- **Sample Size**: [Minimum viable test size]

### A/B Testing Framework
- **Variable A**: [Control group or baseline]
- **Variable B**: [Test group with changes]
- **Success Criteria**: [What constitutes success]
- **Statistical Significance**: [Required confidence level]

## Testing Components
### Message Testing
- **Subject Lines**: Test different subject line approaches
- **Value Propositions**: Test different value prop angles
- **Pain Point Focus**: Test different pain point messaging
- **Call-to-Action**: Test different CTA approaches

### Channel Testing
- **Email**: Primary outbound channel
- **LinkedIn**: Professional networking approach
- **Phone**: Direct outreach method
- **Multi-Channel**: Coordinated approach across channels

### Timing Testing
- **Day of Week**: Test different days
- **Time of Day**: Test different times
- **Frequency**: Test contact frequency
- **Sequence Length**: Test sequence duration

## Testing Process
### Phase 1: Setup
1. Define hypothesis and success metrics
2. Create test groups and control groups
3. Set up tracking and measurement systems

2. Determine statistical significance
3. Identify winning approaches
4. Document learnings

### Phase 4: Implementation
1. Scale winning approaches
2. Update frameworks and templates
3. Train team on new approaches
4. Plan next round of tests

## Success Metrics
