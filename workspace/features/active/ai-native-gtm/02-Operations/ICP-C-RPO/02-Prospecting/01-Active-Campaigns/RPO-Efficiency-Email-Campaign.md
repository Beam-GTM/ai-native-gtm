**Send Date**: Day 1  
**Goal**: Generate initial interest and response

**Content**:
```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is in the RPO space and I have a quick question about efficiency.

Most RPO companies we work with are struggling with the same challenge: processing 1000+ CVs per month while maintaining quality and speed. The manual screening process is eating up 15-20 hours per week that could be spent on higher-value activities.

I'm curious - how is [Company] currently handling CV screening and initial candidate evaluation? Are you finding it challenging to maintain consistency while scaling?

I'd love to share a quick case study of how we helped a similar RPO company achieve 97% accuracy in CV screening while reducing processing time by 67%.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call this week to discuss?

Best regards,

### Email 2: Value Proposition
**Subject**: "97% CV Screening Accuracy for RPO Companies"  
**Send Date**: Day 5  
**Goal**: Provide value and build credibility

**Content**:

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email about RPO efficiency challenges.

I thought you might find this interesting - we recently helped [Similar Company] achieve:

• 97% accuracy in CV screening
• 67% reduction in processing time
• 1000+ CVs processed per month
• 89% cost reduction in screening operations

The key was implementing AI-powered CV screening that learns from your specific requirements and improves over time.

I'm curious - what's your current CV screening process like? Are you using any automation tools, or is it still mostly manual?

If you're interested, I'd be happy to share the full case study and discuss how similar results might apply to [Company].

Would a 15-minute call work for you this week?

Best regards,
Quentin Silvestro

### Email 3: Social Proof
**Subject**: "How [Similar Company] Reduced Time-to-Hire by 67%"  
**Send Date**: Day 10  
**Goal**: Create urgency and social proof

**Content**:
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share one more insight that might be relevant for [Company].

[Similar Company] was facing the same challenges you mentioned - high volume CV processing, quality consistency, and scaling issues. After implementing our AI automation, they achieved:

• Time-to-hire reduced from 3 months to 1 month
• 97% accuracy in candidate screening
• 89% reduction in processing costs
• 100% client satisfaction improvement

The CEO told me: "This has transformed our entire operation. We can now focus on building relationships instead of just processing applications."

I'm curious - if you could reduce your time-to-hire by 67% while improving quality, what would that mean for [Company]'s competitive position?

I have a few slots available this week for a brief discussion. Would you be interested in learning more?

Best regards,
