# System Architecture
**Version**: 3.1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-25

## Overview
Template baseline system for personal automation through AI orchestration. Features lean development agents, natural language-first configuration, always-loaded context system, and automated file management with pattern-based growth from minimal viable components.

## Core Components

### Context and Memory System
- **Always-loaded context**: Ensures continuity across all chat sessions
- **Cross-chat persistence**: Maintains project state and knowledge between conversations  
- **Memory bank structure**: Organized workspace with feature tracking and progress preservation
- **Automatic timestamp loading**: Agents execute timestamp commands for accurate documentation

### Orchestrator Agent
- **Central coordination hub**: Routes tasks and manages workflows with beginner-friendly guidance
- **Lean development focus**: Minimal context overhead for IDE-based coding agents
- **Pattern-based growth**: Starts as single agent, specialists added only when usage patterns emerge
- **Quality gate enforcement**: Automatic best practices application through engineering rules

### File Management System  
- **Automated organization**: Intelligent file placement and cleanup through system operations
- **Safe file movement**: Link integrity preservation during reorganization
- **Interactive cleanup**: User-guided structure optimization with approval gates
- **Emergency recovery**: Backup and restore capabilities for file operations

### Template System
- **Self-contained templates**: YAML files with embedded generation instructions
- **Natural language configuration**: Pure markdown with structured metadata
- **Component generation**: Tool-based creation of agents, workflows, and tasks
- **Registry tracking**: Unified component registry with automatic updates

## Architectural Patterns

### Natural Language First Architecture
- **Markdown everything**: Agents, tasks, templates written in plain English
- **No core programming code**: Framework uses only natural language instructions
- **Self-documenting**: Components include embedded instructions for their own generation

### Lean Development Agent Pattern
- **Minimal context overhead**: Dev agents optimized for IDE use with <64KB context
- **Code-focused**: Development agents concentrate on coding, not documentation
- **Web agents can be complex**: Planning agents in web UI handle complex tasks and larger context

### Context Persistence Pattern
- **Session continuity**: Context automatically loads and persists across chat sessions
- **State preservation**: Work progress and project knowledge maintained between conversations
- **Memory integration**: Workspace memory system tracks features, progress, and learnings

### Automated Best Practices Pattern
- **Engineering rules application**: Automatic application of 37+ engineering standards
- **Quality gate enforcement**: PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED framework throughout processes
- **File organization**: System operations maintain clean structure automatically

## Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Template Baseline System
- **Complete template**: Ready-to-use system for personal automation setup
- **Beginner mode**: Guided onboarding for users setting up their own Nexus system
- **Core functionality**: Single orchestrator handles all tasks with context persistence
- **Foundation rules**: 37+ engineering rules provide automatic best practices

### Phase 2: User Setup and Configuration
- **Personal automation setup**: Users configure system for their specific task automation needs
- **Context establishment**: Memory bank assembly for user's projects and workflows
- **File organization**: Automated cleanup and structure optimization
- **Quality framework**: PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED gates established

### Phase 3: Pattern Recognition and Growth
- **Usage monitoring**: Track repeated task types and coordination patterns
- **Agent extraction**: Create specialist agents when patterns repeat >3 times
- **Workflow creation**: Generate workflows when processes repeat >2 times
- **Template expansion**: Add new templates based on successful patterns

### Phase 4: System Evolution
- **Component generation**: Tool-based creation of new agents, workflows, tasks
- **Registry updates**: Automatic tracking of all system components
- **Validation gates**: Health monitoring and effectiveness measurement
- **Pattern documentation**: Knowledge capture for template improvements

## Implementation Architecture

### File Structure Optimization
- **Small, focused files**: Multiple small files loaded on demand vs. large branching files
- **Dynamic loading**: Resources loaded only when needed for performance
- **Context caching**: Session-based caching with intelligent invalidation
- **Link integrity**: Automatic reference updates during file operations

### Agent Specialization
- **Role-based design**: Each agent represents specific expertise persona
- **Task procedures**: Step-by-step instructions agents follow
- **Dependency declaration**: Explicit requirements for each component
- **Context handoffs**: Seamless state preservation between agent transitions

### Quality Integration
- **Decision framework**: PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED for all quality decisions
- **Evidence collection**: Documentation of decisions with rationale
- **Risk assessment**: Systematic evaluation with numbered scoring
- **User approval gates**: Critical decision points require user confirmation
