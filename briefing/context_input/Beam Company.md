Tech Overview
The Complete Beam AI Stack
Beam AI delivers enterprise-grade autonomous automation through a comprehensive, unified platform architecture. Unlike fragmented approaches requiring integration of multiple disparate tools, Beam AI provides a complete solution where every component is engineered for seamless interoperability, eliminating the "integration tax" that typically consumes 30-40% of development time in modular approaches.
Core Architecture Philosophy
The platform operates on the principle of unified design - a cohesive system where agents achieve 90%+ accuracy while processing over 5,000 tasks per minute. This isn't just about having all the components; it's about having them designed together, optimized together, and evolving together. When you change something in a Beam workflow, the entire stack adapts - prompts re-optimize, tests re-run, integrations adjust automatically.
The Five-Layer Integrated Stack
Layer 1: LLM Infrastructure At the foundation lies a flexible multi-provider LLM infrastructure integrating with leading AI providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini. This multi-provider approach ensures organizations aren't locked into a single vendor while enabling optimal model selection for specific tasks. The system leverages different models for different purposes—using smaller models for classification and larger ones for complex reasoning—maintaining both performance and cost-efficiency across deployments.
Layer 2: Beam AI Core - Unified LLM APIs The Beam AI Core provides a unified API layer that abstracts the complexity of working with multiple LLM providers. This standardization layer handles:
Authentication across all providers
Rate limiting and quota management
Error handling and retry logic
Response formatting and normalization
Dynamic model switching based on task requirements
The unified approach enables seamless provider switching without requiring code changes, while automatically routing requests to the most appropriate and cost-effective model for each operation.
Layer 3: Beam Agent Framework - The Platform Heart The Agent Framework encompasses six critical integrated components that transform raw AI capabilities into reliable business automation:
Agents: Intelligent executors that perceive, reason, and act autonomously within structured business processes.
Flows: Structured workflows derived from Standard Operating Procedures that ensure deterministic execution while maintaining flexibility for AI-driven decision making.
Tools: Enable agents to interact with external systems through 1500+ pre-built integrations, eliminating custom development overhead.
Prompt Optimization: Continuously refines agent instructions for better accuracy through automated testing and feedback loops.
Human Feedback: Creates learning loops that improve agent performance over time, with insights automatically propagated across the entire system.
Test & Eval: Provides comprehensive evaluation frameworks ensuring agents meet production standards before deployment, with continuous monitoring during operation.
Layer 4: Beam Cloud - Flexible Deployment The Beam Cloud layer offers deployment options to meet diverse enterprise needs:
Self-hosted Deployments: Maximum control and data sovereignty for organizations with strict compliance requirements.
Managed Service Options: Simplified operations with enterprise support, reducing operational overhead while maintaining customization capabilities.
Platform (SaaS): Full platform experience for rapid deployment and scaling without infrastructure management.
Managed Integrations/Tools: Pre-built connectors to popular business systems like Salesforce, Gmail, Slack, and Jira, eliminating the need for custom integration development and the associated maintenance burden.
Layer 5: Developer Experience At the top of the stack, dual interfaces serve different user personas while working on the same underlying system:
Beam SDK: Enables developers to programmatically create, deploy, and manage agents using their preferred programming languages and development workflows.
Beam Studio: Visual, no-code environment where business users can design agent workflows, monitor performance, and manage deployments without technical expertise.
This dual approach democratizes AI agent creation while maintaining the sophistication needed for complex enterprise use cases.
The Agent Operating System (Agent OS)
Beam's Agent OS manages the full lifecycle of autonomous agents—from task planning to execution and continuous improvement through four core modules:
1. Execution Runtime Executes task graphs created from SOPs where agents follow deterministic workflows while applying AI reasoning at decision nodes. The runtime maintains state consistency across long-running processes, handles interruptions gracefully, and provides detailed execution logging for audit and debugging purposes.
2. Memory System Supports both long-term memory (historical context, user preferences, learned patterns) and working memory (current task state, intermediate results). Memory is structured and vector-searchable using PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, enabling:
Accurate contextual recall across complex multi-step workflows
Semantic search capabilities for relevant historical information
Efficient storage and retrieval of structured and unstructured data
Version control for memory states enabling rollback capabilities
3. Planner Module Breaks down high-level business goals into structured execution plans by:
Analyzing available workflows, tools, and data paths
Optimizing execution order based on dependencies and resource availability
Creating contingency plans for failure scenarios
Dynamically adapting plans based on real-time conditions and feedback
4. Tool Controller Dynamically selects and invokes tools needed to complete task steps through:
Intelligent tool discovery via Beam's internal registry or Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Automated parameter mapping from agent memory to API input fields
Sophisticated retry and error handling with exponential backoff
Result parsing, validation, and output evaluation
Context preservation across tool invocations
Graph-Based Workflow Engine
Beam represents every business process as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task steps and dependencies, providing:
Node Structure: Each node represents an atomic action or decision containing:
Required inputs and expected outputs
Success/failure evaluation criteria
Fallback procedures and escalation rules
Execution timeouts and resource requirements
Audit metadata and compliance markers
Branch Logic: Each branch defines:
Conditional logic based on previous step outcomes
Parallel execution paths for independent operations
Loop constructs for iterative processes
Error handling and recovery pathways
Metadata Integration: Rich metadata embedded throughout the graph enables:
Precise execution tracking and debugging
Comprehensive audit trails for compliance
Automatic recovery from failure points
Performance optimization based on historical execution data
This graph-based approach allows for precise, auditable, and recoverable execution even across long-running, multi-system workflows spanning hours or days.
Scalable Runtime Infrastructure
Kubernetes-based Orchestration Services are containerized and deployed across clusters enabling:
Horizontal scaling based on workload demands
Zero-downtime rollouts with blue-green deployments
Fault isolation preventing cascade failures across services

Message Broker Architecture Agents and services communicate asynchronously via a distributed message queue system supporting:
Non-blocking execution preventing bottlenecks
Automatic retry with exponential backoff and dead letter queues
Event-driven processing enabling reactive architectures
Message ordering guarantees where required
Exactly-once delivery semantics for critical operations
Task Decomposition & Parallelism Complex agent tasks are automatically decomposed into smaller sub-tasks:
Parallel execution where dependencies allow
Fine-grained checkpointing enabling precise recovery
Resource pooling for optimal utilization
Load balancing across available compute resources
Dynamic scaling based on queue depth and processing times
Runtime Model Switching & AI Efficiency
Agents dynamically select optimal LLMs based on:
Document Analysis:
Length and complexity assessment
Content type identification (technical, legal, conversational)
Language detection and specialized model routing
Task Classification:
Simple classification → lightweight models
Complex reasoning → advanced models (GPT-4, Claude)
Code generation → specialized coding models
Mathematical operations → math-optimized models
Performance Requirements:
Latency constraints for real-time applications
Throughput requirements for batch processing
Cost optimization for high-volume operations
Accuracy thresholds for critical decisions
This intelligent routing optimizes speed and cost while preserving accuracy across diverse use cases, often achieving 40-60% cost reduction compared to static model approaches.

PostgreSQL with pgvector:
Structured storage for task metadata and execution logs
Fast embedding-based retrieval using vector similarity search
ACID compliance for transactional consistency
Advanced indexing for complex queries
Partitioning strategies for large-scale data management
Document Memory Store:
Embeddings storage for semantic memory recall
