# üìÅ Processed Context Archive

## üéØ What This Folder Contains

This folder automatically stores your processed project context files after the system analyzes them for personalization.

## üìÇ Archive Structure

Each context processing session creates a timestamped folder:

```
processed_context/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context-2024-01-15-14-30-22/       # Processing session 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ original_files/                 # Your original files
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-project.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-spec.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis_report.md              # What the system extracted
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personalization_log.md          # How system was customized
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive_manifest.md             # Summary of this processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context-2024-01-20-09-15-45/       # Processing session 2 (if you add more context later)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ latest -> context-2024-01-20-09-15-45/  # Symlink to most recent
```

## üîÑ Automatic Processing

### When Context is Processed:
1. **You add files** ‚Üí `../context_input/` folder
2. **System detects** ‚Üí Files during startup
3. **Analysis happens** ‚Üí AI extracts project info
4. **Files get moved** ‚Üí To timestamped archive here
5. **System personalizes** ‚Üí Based on your context
6. **Input folder cleaned** ‚Üí Ready for next time

### What Gets Archived:
- ‚úÖ **All your original files** - Exactly as you provided them
- ‚úÖ **Analysis report** - What the system understood
- ‚úÖ **Personalization log** - How it customized itself
- ‚úÖ **Processing manifest** - Summary of the session

### `archive_manifest.md`
Quick summary:
```markdown
# Archive Manifest

**Processing Date**: 2024-01-15 14:30:22
**Files Processed**: 4 files
**Project Type**: E-commerce Web App
**Personalization**: Complete
**System Status**: Ready for development
```

## üéØ Using Archived Context

### View Your Context
```bash
# See what context was processed
cat processed_context/latest/analysis_report.md

# View personalization details
cat processed_context/latest/personalization_log.md

# Check original files
ls processed_context/latest/original_files/
```

### Update Context
If you want to add more context later:
1. Drop new files in `../context_input/`
2. System processes incrementally
3. Creates new timestamped archive
4. Merges with existing personalization

## üîç Archive Benefits

### Perfect Memory
- **Never lose context** - Always available
- **Track evolution** - See how project understanding grew
- **Compare versions** - Multiple processing sessions
- **Audit trail** - Know what influenced personalization

### System Intelligence
- **Learning base** - System learns from your patterns
- **Template improvement** - Better defaults for similar projects
- **Agent training** - Smarter responses based on your domain
- **Workflow optimization** - More relevant suggestions

## üßπ Archive Maintenance

### Automatic Cleanup
- Archives are kept indefinitely by default
- Each archive is small (typically < 10MB)
- No automatic deletion (your context is valuable)

### Manual Cleanup (If Needed)
```bash
# Remove old archives (careful!)
rm -rf processed_context/context-YYYY-MM-DD-*

# Keep only latest
# (Not recommended - context history is valuable)
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Better Context Analysis
- **Be descriptive** - More detailed files = better personalization
- **Include examples** - Show what you want to build
- **Add context files** - Requirements, user stories, technical specs
