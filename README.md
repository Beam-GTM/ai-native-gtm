# Nexus Template - Language-Based Operating System

## 🚀 Quick Start (60 seconds)

### Claude Code Users:
```bash
claude hi
```

### Cursor Users:
1. Type: `@orchestrator.md`
2. Say: "hi"

## 🎯 What is Nexus?

Nexus is a revolutionary Language-Based Operating System where:
- **Natural language IS the programming language**
- **YAML/Markdown files ARE executable programs**
- **AI agents provide specialized expertise**
- **Your system learns and evolves with usage**

## ✨ Features

- **12+ Specialized AI Agents**: Developer, Architect, QA, UX Expert, and more
- **Intelligent Workflows**: Plan features, implement code, manage projects
- **🗺️ Structure Maps**: Visual navigation and dependency analysis for complex systems
- **Self-Learning System**: Captures patterns and improves over time
- **Evidence-Based Progress**: Real progress tracking, not estimates
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation and testing frameworks

## 📁 Structure

├── workspace/      # Your active work area
├── briefing/       # Project configuration
└── templates/      # Reusable components
```

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Start**: Always begin with the orchestrator
2. **Navigate**: Use Structure Maps to understand your system visually
3. **Interact**: Use natural language to describe what you want
4. **Build**: The system helps you create features systematically
5. **Learn**: Your system captures patterns and improves

## 🗺️ Structure Maps - Visual System Navigation

As your Nexus system grows, Structure Maps help you:

- **🧭 Navigate Complex Systems**: Visual diagrams showing how components connect
- **🔗 Understand Dependencies**: See what files depend on each other
- **📊 Impact Analysis**: Know what changes when you modify something
- **🎯 Find Components Fast**: Skip hunting through hundreds of files

**Quick Start with Structure Maps:**
```bash
# Generate your first system map
*task generate-structure-maps

# This creates visual diagrams, dependency analysis, 
# and navigation aids for your entire system
```

See `structure/README.md` for complete Structure Maps documentation.
