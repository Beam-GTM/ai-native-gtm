# üéØ APPRAISAL BATTLE CARD

## üöÄ **OPENING (30 seconds)**
**"I want to discuss a business problem I see that needs solving."**

---

## üìä **THE SITUATION (2 minutes)**

### **Current Reality:**
- **80 hours/week** just for sales
- **90% of revenue** on my shoulders
- **Current candidate failing** despite support
- **Can't scale** beyond individual contributor model

### **The Risk:**
- **Too dependent** on one person
- **Unsustainable** workload model
- **No redundancy** in critical functions
- **Growth bottleneck** at individual level

---

## üéØ **THE NEED (1 minute)**

### **What Company Needs:**
- **Systems** that others can follow
- **Redundancy** in critical functions
- **Scalable processes** that don't depend on me
- **Someone** to own the sales function

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Risk mitigation** - what if I get sick/leave?
- **Growth enablement** - can't scale with 80-hour weeks
- **Operational stability** - need backup systems
- **Strategic focus** - CEO needs to focus on strategy, not sales

---

## üí° **THE SOLUTION (2 minutes)**

### **The Core Tension:**
**"There's a tension between letting me do what I'm good at (closing deals) and pulling me away to build systems. I'm not even sure I'm capable of or want to do the systems building part."**

### **Proposed Structure:**
- **Current candidate** ‚Üí Head of Prospecting/Lead Gen
- **Me** ‚Üí Head of Sales (Pipeline Management)
- **My focus** ‚Üí Systems building + North America
- **Result** ‚Üí Reduced dependency + scalable growth

### **Why This Works:**
- **Current candidate** gets focused role they can succeed in
- **I build systems** that others can follow
- **Company gets** reduced risk and scalable processes
- **CEO gets** someone to own sales function

### **The Honest Reality:**
**"I'm good at closing deals. I'm not sure I'm good at building systems or managing people. But I'm the only one who knows how I do what I do, so I'm the only one who can document it."**

---

## üéØ **KEY MESSAGES**

### **Repeat These:**
1. **"This is a business problem that needs solving"**
2. **"We can't scale with the current model"**
3. **"I'm the only one who can document how I do what I do"**
4. **"There's tension between doing what I'm good at vs. building systems"**
5. **"This reduces risk and enables growth"**

### **Avoid These:**
- ‚ùå "I want to become head of sales"
- ‚ùå "I want to focus on North America"
- ‚ùå "I want to delegate my work"
- ‚ùå "I want to do what I want"

---

## üö® **ANTICIPATED PUSHBACK**

### **"What about European operations?"**
**Response:** "I'll stay hands-on until systems are proven. Current candidate can handle European prospecting while I build systems."

### **"What about the current candidate?"**
**Response:** "They need a focused role they can succeed in. Prospecting/Lead Gen is narrower and clearer than full sales management."

### **"What about delegation?"**
**Response:** "I'll prove systems work while staying hands-on, then gradually delegate as systems prove effective."

### **"What about complexity?"**
**Response:** "This actually simplifies things - clear roles, clear responsibilities, clear success metrics."

### **"What if you're not good at building systems?"**
**Response:** "That's a valid concern. I'm good at closing deals, not sure about systems. But I'm the only one who knows how I do what I do, so I'm the only one who can document it. We can start small and see if it works."

### **"What if you don't want to do systems building?"**
**Response:** "I'm honest about that tension. I want to do what I'm good at, but the company needs systems. Let's figure out how to balance both - maybe I document while still closing deals."

## üéØ **QUESTIONS TO ASK**

### **Get CEO Input:**
1. **"What do you think about this situation?"**
2. **"How do you see us solving this?"**
3. **"What would success look like?"**
4. **"What are your concerns?"**

### **Understand Constraints:**
1. **"What are the biggest risks you see?"**
2. **"What would need to happen for this to work?"**
3. **"What support would you need to provide?"**
4. **"What timeline makes sense?"**

### **Address the Tension:**
1. **"How do we balance me doing what I'm good at vs. building systems?"**
2. **"What if I'm not good at systems building?"**
3. **"How do we test this approach without risking current revenue?"**
4. **"What's the minimum viable approach to start with?"**

## üí™ **CLOSING (1 minute)**

### **Summary:**
**"So we have a business problem - unsustainable dependency on one person working 80 hours. We need systems that others can follow. I'm the only one who can build these systems. Let's discuss how to make this work."**

### **Next Steps:**
- **Get CEO's perspective** on the situation
- **Identify their concerns** and constraints
- **Align on success metrics** and timeline
- **Create action plan** for implementation

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **What Success Looks Like:**
- **Reduced dependency** on me (from 90% to 60% revenue)
- **Current candidate succeeding** in focused role
- **Systems documented** and others can follow
- **North America expansion** progressing
- **My hours reduced** from 80 to 60

### **What Failure Looks Like:**
- **Status quo maintained** (80 hours, 90% dependency)
- **Current candidate continues failing**
- **No systems built** for scalability
- **Growth bottleneck** remains

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY RESPONSES**

### **If CEO Says "No":**
**"I understand. What do you see as the alternative? How do we solve the dependency problem?"**

### **If CEO Says "Maybe":**
**"What would need to happen for this to work? What are your concerns?"**

### **If CEO Says "Yes":**
**"Great. What's the timeline? What support do you need to provide?"**

## üí° **REMEMBER**

- **You're solving a business problem, not asking for a favor**
- **You're the only one who can build these systems**
- **This reduces risk and enables growth**
- **Stay focused on company needs, not personal wants**

*Good luck! You've got this! üöÄ*
