# Personal Projects

This folder contains your active personal projects.

## 📋 Project Organization

Each project should have its own folder with:
- `README.md` - Project overview and goals
- `notes/` - Project-specific notes
- `resources/` - Project-related files and links
- `archive/` - Completed project components

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Create a new folder for your project
2. Add a README.md with project description
3. Set up subfolders as needed
4. Start documenting your progress

## 📝 Project Template

Use this structure for new projects:
```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Project overview
├── notes/            # Project notes
├── resources/        # Project files
├── archive/          # Completed work
└── docs/            # Documentation
```
