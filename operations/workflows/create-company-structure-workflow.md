<!-- ðŸ”´ DIRECTIVE #1 ENFORCEMENT: ALWAYS READ COMPLETE FILES -->
<!-- CRITICAL: This workflow reads multiple files - never use limit parameter -->
<!-- This directive OVERRIDES token conservation - read files completely -->
<!-- VIOLATION = Missing critical workflow steps and validation processes -->

## ðŸ”´ PRE-WORKFLOW DIRECTIVE CHECK + BEHAVIORAL CORRECTION
**MANDATORY**: Before executing this workflow, verify:
- [ ] All file reads will use complete files (no limit parameter)
- [ ] Agent file reads will capture complete operational instructions
- [ ] Task file reads will be comprehensive for proper execution
- [ ] Context file reads will provide complete workflow state

## ðŸ§  BEHAVIORAL CORRECTION PROTOCOL (Mental Model Framework)
**MANDATORY FIRST**: Apply behavioral pattern prevention before workflow execution:
{{load_behavioral_patterns: workflow_patterns}}
<!-- Loads: execution_documentation_paradox, false_completion_syndrome, basic_operations_failure -->

## Workflow Definition

```yaml
workflow:
  id: create-company-structure
  name: Company Folder Structure Creation
  description: >-
    Automated workflow for creating standardized company folder structures
    for the transcript processing automation system. Creates consistent
    organizational hierarchy for transcripts, emails, and documents.
  type: specialized
  project_types:
    - sales-automation
    - document-organization
    - company-onboarding
  complexity: low
  target_system: filesystem

context:
  situation: 'User identifies new company requiring folder structure for transcript processing'
  assumptions:
    - 'Company name provided by user'
    - 'Standard three-folder structure required'
    - 'Filesystem write access available'
  success_criteria:
    - 'Company folder created with proper naming'
    - 'Three sub-folders created: transcripts, emails, documents'
    - 'Structure validation completed'
    - 'Ready for transcript processing workflow'

# WORKFLOW SEQUENCE
sequence:
  - step: company_identification
    agent: orchestrator
    action: 'Collect and validate company name input'
    creates: company_name_validated
    requires: []
    integrated_task: framework/tasks/memory/update-project-memory.md
    notes: |
      Company name collection and validation:
      - Prompt user for company name
      - Apply naming conventions (remove special characters if needed)
      - Validate uniqueness (check if folder already exists)
      - Confirm name with user before proceeding
      
      SAVE OUTPUT: Validated company name for folder creation

  - step: folder_structure_creation
    agent: orchestrator
    action: 'Create standardized company folder structure'
    creates: company_folder_structure
    requires:
      - company_name_validated
    integrated_task: framework/tasks/memory/update-project-memory.md
    notes: |
      Folder structure creation:
      - Create Companies/{company-name}/ directory
      - Create Companies/{company-name}/transcripts/ subdirectory
      - Create Companies/{company-name}/emails/ subdirectory  
      - Create Companies/{company-name}/documents/ subdirectory
      - Verify all folders created successfully
      
      SAVE OUTPUT: Complete folder structure ready for use

  - step: structure_validation
    agent: orchestrator
    action: 'Validate folder structure and confirm readiness'
    creates: validation_complete
    requires:
      - company_folder_structure
    integrated_task: framework/tasks/memory/update-project-memory.md
    notes: |
      Structure validation:
      - Verify all three folders exist and are accessible
      - Check folder permissions are correct
      - Confirm structure matches standard template
      - Report successful creation to user
      
      SAVE OUTPUT: Validation confirmation and readiness status

# QUALITY GATES

    required_evidence:
      - 'company_name_validated'

  - gate: folder_structure_complete
    trigger: 'after folder_structure_creation'
    criteria:

      - 'Folder structure matches template'
      - 'No filesystem errors during creation'

    required_evidence:
      - 'validation_complete'

# HANDOFF PROTOCOL
handoff_protocol:

      Company Structure Created - Ready for Transcript Processing
      
      Company: {company-name}
      Structure: Companies/{company-name}/transcripts/emails/documents/
      Status: Validated and ready
      
      Transcript processing can now proceed with:
      - Organized storage location ready
      - Standardized folder structure
      - Proper file organization foundation
      
      Next: Process transcripts using transcript-processing-automation
