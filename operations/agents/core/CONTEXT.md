# Core Agents Context - System Coordination Agents

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22T19:00:00Z  
**Purpose**: Core system coordination agents that provide central orchestration and architectural guidance  
**Scope**: Central coordination, system architecture, and knowledge transfer agents

## üìã **PREREQUISITE CONTEXTS**

**Essential Context Chain** (Follow these references for complete understanding):
1. `../../../AI-NAVIGATION-INDEX.md` - Master system navigation (contains foundation prerequisites)
2. `../../OPERATIONS-CONTEXT.md` - Operations domain navigation and rules
3. `../../../operations/engineeringrules/context-map.md` - Complete system navigation

**Context Loading Note**: Prerequisites provide foundation for understanding core agent coordination patterns

## üéØ **SUBSYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The **Core Agents** are the foundational coordination agents that provide central orchestration, system architecture, and knowledge transfer capabilities. These agents form the backbone of the Nexus system's coordination and guidance infrastructure.

### **Core Purpose**
- **System Coordination**: Central orchestration and agent coordination across the entire ecosystem
- **Architectural Leadership**: System design, architecture decisions, and technical leadership  
- **Knowledge Transfer**: System explanation, guidance, and educational support for users

## üìÅ **STRUCTURE & NAVIGATION**

### **üéº orchestrator.md** - Central System Coordination
**Purpose**: Master coordination agent (Nexus) that manages all agent interactions and system workflows

```
Agent: Nexus - Nexus System Orchestrator  
Icon: üéºüéØ
Specialization: Agent coordination, workflow management, system generation
```

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Agent Switching**: Transform between any specialized agent with context preservation
- **Workflow Execution**: Complete multi-agent workflow coordination and management
- **System Generation**: Domain-specific system generation with NEXIS Evolution capabilities
- **Quality Orchestration**: Coordinate quality gates and validation across all processes

**Navigation Tips**:
- Use `@orchestrator.md` to transform into Nexus for central coordination
- Primary entry point for most system operations and agent coordination
- Commands: `*help`, `*agent {name}`, `*workflow {type}`, `*generate-system {domain}`

### **üèóÔ∏è architect.md** - System Architecture & Design
**Purpose**: Master architecture agent (Orion) that handles system design and technical leadership

### **üéì explainer.md** - System Explanation & Guidance  
**Purpose**: Master explanation agent (Axiom) that provides system understanding and knowledge transfer

```
Agent: Axiom - System Explainer
Icon: üéì
Specialization: System explanation, knowledge transfer, educational guidance
```

**Key Capabilities**:
- **System Explanation**: Complete system understanding and step-by-step guidance
